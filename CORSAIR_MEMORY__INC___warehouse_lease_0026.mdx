              proposed Tenant Improvement Work would trigger the necessity under Laws or otherwise for work to be performed
              outside the Premises; (d) the specifications for the proposed Tenant Improvements are not consistent with, or would
              detract from, the character or image of the Project; or (e) the proposed Tenant Improvement Work is specialized for
              Tenant’s particular use and would not be used by typical warehouse/industrial tenants. If Landlord disapproves the
              Space Plans, Landlord shall return the Space Plans to Tenant with a statement of Landlord’s reasons for disapproval,
              or specifying any required corrections and/or revisions. Landlord shall approve or disapprove of any revisions to the
              Space Plans by written notice given to Tenant within five (5) business days after receipt of such revisions. This
              procedure shall be repeated until Landlord approves the Space Plans.

                        2.3 Final Working Drawings. Following Landlord’s approval of the Space Plans, Tenant shall cause
              Tenant’s Architect and the Engineers to prepare and submit for Landlord’s approval complete and detailed
              construction plans and specifications, including a fully coordinated set of architectural, structural, mechanical, fire
              protection, electrical and plumbing working drawings for the Tenant Improvement Work, in a form which is
              sufficiently complete to permit subcontractors to bid on the work, obtain all required Permits (as hereinafter defined)
              and commence construction (the “Final Working Drawings”). Tenant shall furnish Landlord with four (4) copies
              signed by Tenant of such Final Working Drawings. Landlord shall approve or disapprove of the Final Working
              Drawings by giving written notice to Tenant within ten (10) business days after receipt thereof. Landlord shall not
              unreasonably withhold or delay its approval of the Final Working Drawings, provided that, without limiting the
              generality of the foregoing, Landlord shall be entitled to withhold its consent to the Final Working Drawings for any
              of the reasons specified in clauses (a) through (e) of Section 2.2 above, or if in Landlord’s good faith judgment, the
              Final Working Drawings are inconsistent with, or do not conform to, the Space Plans. If Landlord disapproves the
              Final Working Drawings, Landlord shall return the Final Working Drawings to Tenant with a statement of
              Landlord’s reasons for disapproval and/or specifying any required corrections or revisions. Landlord shall approve
              or disapprove of any such revisions to the Final Working Drawings within five (5) business days after receipt of
              such revisions. This procedure shall be repeated until Landlord approves the Final Working Drawings (as so
              approved, the “Approved Working Drawings”).

                   3. Construction of Tenant Improvements.

                        3.1 Contracts with Tenant’s Contractor and Subcontractors.

                              (a) Tenant shall retain a licensed general contractor as the contractor for the construction of the
              Tenant Improvements (“Tenant’s Contractor”). Tenant’s Contractor must be experienced in the performance of
              work comparable to the work of the Tenant Improvements in buildings comparable to the Building, and shall be
              subject to Landlord’s prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. All
              subcontractors, laborers, materialmen and suppliers used by Tenant (such subcontractors, laborers, materialmen and
              suppliers, together with Tenant’s Contractor, are collectively referred to herein as “Tenant’s Construction Agents”)
              must be approved in writing by Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
              that Landlord reserves the right to require that any work to be performed on the Systems be performed by
              subcontractors specified by Landlord.

                                                                      Exhibit B–3






                               (b) Upon Tenant’s execution thereof, Tenant shall furnish Landlord with true and correct copies of all
              construction contracts between or among Tenant, Tenant’s Contractor and all subcontractors relating to the Tenant
              Improvement Work, provided that Landlord’s review of such contracts shall not relieve Tenant from its obligations
              under this Work Letter nor shall such review be deemed to constitute Landlord’s representation that such contracts
              comply with the requirements of this Work Letter. All such contracts shall expressly provide that (i) the work to be
              performed thereunder shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Work Letter, including, without limitation,
              that such work shall comply with the Tenant Construction Rules and Regulations for the Project in effect from time
              to time, and (ii) the Tenant Improvement Work (or in the case of a subcontractor, the portion thereof performed by
              such subcontractor) shall be warranted in writing to Tenant and Landlord to be free from any defects in
              workmanship and materials for a period of not less than one (1) year from the date of completion of the Tenant
              Improvement Work. Tenant agrees to give to Landlord any assignment or other assurances which may be necessary
              to permit Landlord to directly, enforce such warranties (such warranties shall include, without additional charge, the
              repair of any portion of the Building or Common Areas which may be damaged as a result of the removal or
              replacement of the defective Tenant Improvements). Tenant shall cause Tenant’s Construction Agents to engage only
              labor that is harmonious and compatible with other labor working in the Project. In the event of any labor
              disturbance caused by persons employed by Tenant or Tenant’s Contractor, Tenant shall immediately take all actions
              necessary to eliminate such disturbance. If at any time any of Tenant’s Construction Agents interferes with any other
              occupant of the Project, or hinders or delays any other work of improvement in the Project, or performs any work
              which may or does impair the quality, integrity or performance of any portion of the Project, including any portions
              of the Systems, Tenant shall cause such subcontractor, laborer, materialman or supplier to leave the Project and
              remove all tools, equipment and materials immediately upon written notice delivered to Tenant, and, without
              limiting Tenant’s indemnity obligations set forth in Paragraph 16 of the Lease, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for
              all costs, expenses, losses or damages incurred or suffered by Landlord resulting from the acts or omissions of
              Tenant’s Construction Agents in or about the Project.

                        3.2 Permits. Following approval of the Final Working Drawings, Tenant shall obtain all building permits
              and other permits, authorizations and approvals which may be required in connection with, or to satisfy all Laws
              applicable to, the construction of the Tenant Improvements in accordance with the Approved Working Drawings (the
              “Permits”). Tenant shall provide Landlord with copies of any documents or applications filed by Tenant to obtain
              Permits concurrently with any such filing, but in no event shall Tenant file any such documents or applications until
              the Final Working Drawings have been approved. Tenant agrees that neither Landlord nor Landlord’s consultants
              shall be responsible for obtaining any Permits or the certificate of occupancy for the Premises, and that obtaining the
              same shall be Tenant’s responsibility; provided, however, that Landlord will cooperate with Tenant in executing
              permit applications and performing other ministerial acts reasonably necessary to enable Tenant to obtain any such
              Permit or certificate of occupancy. Any amendments or revisions to the Approved Working Drawings that may be
              necessary to obtain any such Permits, or which may be required by city officials or inspectors to comply with code
              rulings or interpretations, shall be prepared by Tenant’s Architect, at Tenant’s expense, and submitted to Landlord
              for Landlord’s review and approval as a Change Order under Section 5 below. If Landlord disapproves of such
              amendments or revisions, Landlord shall return the same to Tenant with a statement of

                                                                      Exhibit B–4
