                                                                     EXHIBIT B

                                                            TENANT IMPROVEMENT
                                                               WORK LETTER

                   This Work Letter is attached to and forms a part of the Warehouse/Industrial Lease Agreement dated
              January 18, 2005 (the “Lease”), by and between Sutter Hill Investors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
              (“Landlord”), and Corsair Memory, Inc., a California corporation (“Tenant”), pertaining to certain premises
              located at 46221-46231 Landing Parkway, Fremont, California. Except where clearly inconsistent or inapplicable,
              the provisions of the Lease are incorporated into this Work Letter, and capitalized terms used without being defined
              in this Work Letter shall have the meanings given them in the Lease.

                   The purpose of this Work Letter is to set forth the respective responsibilities of Landlord and Tenant with
              respect to the design and construction of all alterations, additions and improvements which Tenant may deem
              necessary or appropriate to prepare the Premises for occupancy by Tenant under the Lease. Such alterations,
              additions and improvements to the Premises are referred to in this Work Letter as the “Tenant Improvements,” and
              the work of constructing the Tenant Improvements is referred to as the “Tenant Improvement Work.”

                   Landlord and Tenant agree as follows:

                   1. General.

                     1.1 Tenant is solely responsible for designing the Tenant Improvements and performing the Tenant
              Improvement Work (subject to Landlord’s rights of review and approval set forth in this Work Letter).

                        1.2 Landlord’s sole interest in reviewing and approving the Construction Drawings (as hereinafter defined)
              is to protect the Project and Landlord’s interests, and no such review or approval by Landlord shall be deemed to
              create any liability of any kind on the part of Landlord, or constitute a representation on the part of Landlord or any
              person consulted by Landlord in connection with such review and approval that the Space Plans or Final Working
              Drawings are correct or accurate, or are in compliance with any Laws.

                       1.3 Tenant shall be responsible for all costs of designing the Tenant Improvements and performing the
              Tenant Improvement Work.

                        1.4 On reasonable prior notice, Landlord will permit Tenant and Tenant’s Construction Agents (as defined
              below) to enter the Premises from time to time prior to the Estimated Commencement Date for the sole purpose of
              performing the Tenant Improvement Work. Tenant shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold Landlord and
              Landlord’s Agents harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, liabilities, judgments, costs, demands, causes
              of action and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements)
              (“Claims”) suffered or incurred by Landlord or Landlord’s Agents arising from such entry.

                                                                      Exhibit B–1






                        1.5 Any default by Tenant under this Exhibit B shall constitute a default under the Lease. If a Default
              occurs under the Lease or a default occurs under this Work Letter at any time on or before the Commencement Date,
              then in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to Landlord under the Lease, Landlord shall have the right
              to cause Tenant’s Contractor to cease construction of the Tenant Improvements and all other obligations of Landlord
              under this Work Letter shall be suspended until such time as the default is cured.

                        1.6 If the Building and/or the Premises is damaged by fire or other casualty prior to the Commencement
              Date, the Commencement Date shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of the casualty, and the rights and
              obligations of the parties shall be governed by Paragraph 21 of the Lease.

                   2. Design and Approval of the Tenant Improvements.

                        2.1 Selection of Tenant’s Architect; Construction Drawings.

                              (a) Tenant shall retain an architect/space planner (“Tenant’s Architect”) to prepare the Construction
              Drawings. Tenant’s Architect shall be subject to the written approval of Landlord, which approval will not be
              unreasonably withheld or delayed. Tenant shall retain engineering consultants designated by Landlord (the
              “Engineers”) to prepare all plans and engineering working drawings relating to work to be performed on the
              structural portions of the Building or the Systems in the Premises, if any, in connection with the Tenant
              Improvements. The plans and drawings to be prepared by Tenant’s Architect and the Engineers hereunder shall be
              known, collectively, as the “Construction Drawings”.

                              (b) If readily available, Landlord may supply Tenant with a set of drawings of the Building which
              Tenant may use in connection with the preparation of the Construction Drawings, but Tenant agrees that Landlord
              shall have no liability for the completeness or accuracy thereof, and Tenant’s Architect shall be responsible for
              performing all necessary field measurements and confirming the completeness and accuracy of such drawings.

                        2.2 Space Plans. Prior to drafting any Construction Drawings, Tenant shall furnish Landlord with Tenant’s
              final space plans for the Premises (“Space Plans”). The Space Plans shall show locations of all proposed
              improvements, including partitions, cabinetry, equipment and fixtures, shall identify materials and finishes by
              location, and shall specify the location of any proposed structural floor penetrations, the location and extent of floor
              loading in excess of Building capacity, if any, any special HVAC requirements, the location and description of any
              special plumbing requirements, and any special electrical requirements. In addition, the Space Plans shall show
              telephone and telecommunications facilities, and computer and electronic data facilities. Landlord shall approve or
              disapprove the Space Plans by written notice given to Tenant within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Space
              Plans. Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold its approval of the Space Plans, provided that, without limiting the
              generality of the foregoing, Landlord shall be entitled to withhold its consent to the Space Plans if, in Landlord’s
              good faith judgment, any one or more of the following situations exist: (a) the proposed Tenant Improvements will
              adversely affect the exterior appearance of the Building; (b) the proposed Tenant Improvements may impair the
              structural strength of the Building, adversely affect any Systems or materially adversely affect the value of the
              Building; (c) the

                                                                      Exhibit B–2
