(a) The effective date of this Lease shall be considered to be the date of the last execution or initialing hereof.

(b) All of the covenants of Tenant hereunder shall be deemed and construed to be “conditions” as well as “covenants” as though both words were used in each separate instance.

(c) This Lease shall not be recorded by Tenant without the prior written consent of Landlord. Cost of recordation, if any, is to be borne by the recording party.

(d) The paragraph or section headings appearing in this Lease are inserted only as a matter of convenience, and in no way define or limit the scope of any paragraph.

(e) Submission of this Lease shall not be deemed to be an offer, or an acceptance, or a reservation of the Premises; and Landlord shall not be bound hereby until Landlord has delivered to Tenant a fully executed copy of this Lease, signed by both of the parties on the last page of this Lease in the spaces herein provided. Until such delivery, Landlord reserves the right to exhibit and lease the Premises to other prospective tenants. Further, Landlord may withhold possession of the Premises from Tenant until such time as Tenant has paid to Landlord the security deposit required by Section 26 of this Lease, and the first month of Base Rent as set forth in Section 4 of this Lease:

(f) All of the terms of this Lease shall extend to Landlord and Tenant, their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns (except as regarding Tenant’s benefit hereunder, Tenant’s permitted successors and permitted assigns) and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Landlord hereby grants Tenant the right of quiet enjoyment of the Premises so long as Tenant is not in default of this Lease.

(g) This Lease and the parties’ respective rights hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of [Maryland](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.lawinsider.com/contracts/tagged/maryland-us). In the event of litigation, suit shall be brought in Xxxxxx County, [Maryland](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.lawinsider.com/contracts/tagged/maryland-us). LANDLORD AND TENANT HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY ISSUE TO ENFORCE ANY TERM OR CONDITION OF THIS LEASE, OR WITH RESPECT TO LANDLORD’S RIGHT TO TERMINATE THIS LEASE, OR WITH RESPECT TO RENT, OR WITH RESPECT TO LANDLORD’S RIGHT TO TERMINATE TENANT’S RIGHT OF POSSESSION. ANY COST AND EXPENSE INCURRED BY LANDLORD TO COLLECT ANY SUMS DUE. OR TO ENFORCE ANY TERM OR PROVISION HEREOF, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES, SHALL BE PAID BY TENANT.

(h) Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 7, no abatement, refund, offset, diminution or reduction of rent, charges or other compensation shall be claimed by or allowed to Tenant, or any person claiming under Tenant, under any circumstances, whether for inconvenience, discomfort, interruption of business, or otherwise, arising from the making of alterations, changes, additions, improvements or repairs to or at the Leased Premises, by virtue or because of any present or future governmental laws, ordinances, or for any other cause or reason. In the event Landlord commences proceedings for non-payment of rent or because of any other default by Tenant hereunder, Tenant will not interpose any counterclaim of whatsoever nature or description in any such proceeding, except as such may be required by law to be interposed or forever lost. This shall not, however, be construed in any way as a waiver of Tenant’s right to assert such claims in any separate action or actions brought by Tenant. Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws in the event of Tenant’s being evicted or dispossessed for any cause or in the event of Landlord’s obtaining possession of the Premises by reason of the violation by Tenant of any of the covenants or conditions of this Lease or otherwise.
