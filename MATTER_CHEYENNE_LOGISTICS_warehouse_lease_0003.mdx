                               3.1       Commencement Date. The Premises shall be deemed to be "Substantially
                                         Complete" on the date on which: the Tenant Improvements have been
                                         performed (or would have been performed absent any Tenant Delay (as herein
                                         defined)), other than any details of construction, mechanical adjustment or any
                                         other matter, the noncompletion of which does not materially interfere with
                                         Tenant’s use of the Premises for the Permitted Use. “Tenant Delay” shall mean
                                         any delay in the performance of the Tenant Improvements as a result of the acts
                                         or omissions of Tenant or any Tenant Party (as herein defined) or their respective
                                         contractors or vendors, including, without limitation, changes requested by
                                         Tenant to approved plans, Tenant’s failure to comply with any of its obligations
                                         under this Lease, Tenant’s failure to install furniture, equipment or
                                         telecommunications cable in the Premises within the time periods specified by
                                         Landlord and to the extent required in order for Landlord to obtain all approvals
                                         necessary for the occupancy of the Premises, Tenant’s failure to complete work
                                         on or to the Premises to be performed by Tenant, or Tenant’s specification of any
                                         materials or equipment with long lead times not specifically identified in the
                                         approved plans. Tenant shall execute and return (or, by notice to Landlord,
                                         reasonably object to) a notice substantially in the form of Exhibit E, as a
                                         confirmation of the information set forth therein within thirty (30) days after
                                         receiving it from Landlord, and if Tenant fails to do so, Tenant shall be deemed
                                         to have executed and returned it without exception.

                               3.2       Possession. In the event that Landlord fails to Substantially Complete the Tenant
                                         Improvements by the date which is one hundred twelve (112) days after the date
                                         upon which this Lease has been executed and delivered by Landlord and Tenant,
                                         for reasons other than Force Majeure events or Tenant Delays, then Tenant, as
                                         Tenant’s sole remedy, shall be entitled to one (1) day of rental abatement for
                                         each one (1) day the Tenant Improvements are not Substantially Completed
                                         beyond such one hundred twelfth (112th) day, which shall be attributable to the
                                         Rent incurred upon and after the Commencement Date. The Commencement
                                         Date for the Premises shall be postponed until the date Landlord delivers
                                         possession of the Premises Substantially Complete. Except as otherwise


                                                                 Document




                                         provided in this Lease, Tenant shall not be permitted to take possession of or
                                         enter the Premises prior to the Commencement Date without Landlord’s
                                         approval. If Tenant takes possession of or enters the Premises before the
                                         Commencement Date as agreed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit J, Tenant shall
                                         be subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease; provided, however, except
                                         for the cost of services requested by Tenant (e.g. electricity, HVAC service, etc.),
                                         Tenant shall not be required to pay Rent for any entry or possession before the
                                         Commencement Date during which Tenant, with Landlord’s approval, has
                                         entered, or is in possession of, the Premises for the sole purpose of performing
                                         improvements or installing furniture, equipment or other personal property,
                                         storage of goods and providing certain services as provided in Exhibit J.

                               defined) and Operating Expenses (as herein defined), in advance, on the first day of each
                               calendar month. All Rent and payments required to be paid by Tenant to Landlord shall
                               be made by Tenant payable to the entity and sent to the address Landlord designates and
                               shall be made by good and sufficient check payable in

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                                4







                               United States of America currency or by other means acceptable to Landlord or by
                               Electronic Fund Transfer of immediately available federal funds before 11:00 a.m.
                               Eastern Time. Upon the execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the first
                               month’s Base Rent, the first monthly installment of estimated Operating Expenses. If the
                               Term commences (or ends) on a date other than the first (or last) day of a month, Base
                               Rent shall be prorated on the basis of a thirty (30) day month. All sums other than Base
                               Rent which Tenant is obligated to pay under this Lease shall be deemed to be additional
                               rent due hereunder ("Additional Rent"), whether or not such sums are designated
                               Additional Rent. The term "Rent" means the Base Rent and all Additional Rent payable
                               hereunder. The obligation of Tenant to pay Base Rent and other sums to Landlord and
                               the obligations of Landlord under this Lease are independent obligations. Tenant shall
                               have no right at any time to abate, reduce, or set-off any rent due hereunder except as
                               may be expressly provided in this Lease. If Tenant is delinquent in any monthly
                               installment of Base Rent or Additional Rent for more than five (5) days, Tenant shall pay
                               to Landlord on demand a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of such delinquent sum
                               and such delinquent sum shall also bear interest from the date such amount was due until
                               paid in full at the lesser of (i) fifteen percent (15%) per annum; or (ii) at the maximum
                               rate permitted by law ("Applicable Interest Rate"). The provision for such late charge
                               shall be in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies hereunder or at law and
                               shall not be construed as a penalty.

                     5.        INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.
                     6.        UTILITIES

                               6.1       Utilities. Tenant shall pay all charges for heat, water, gas, electricity, telephone,
                                         internet and any other utilities and services used on or provided to the Premises,
                                         along with any taxes, penalties, and surcharges related thereto and any
                                         maintenance and facility charges in connection with the provision of such
                                         utilities. If certain utilities are furnished to the Premises in common with other
                                         premises, then Landlord shall make a reasonable good faith estimate as to the
                                         amount used by each tenant (including Tenant) and bill each tenant accordingly;
                                         however, at any time, Landlord may elect to install one or more sub-meters for
                                         one or more premises (which, if installed at the Premises, shall be at Landlord’s
                                         expenses) in which event Landlord will bill each tenant whose premises is sub-
                                         metered for the amount used according to that tenant’s sub-meter. Any amounts
                                         which Landlord bills to Tenant under the terms of this Section 6.1 will be
                                         considered Additional Rent and will be due within thirty (30) days after the date
                                         upon which Landlord delivers such bill to Tenant.
                               6.2       Interruption of Utilities. Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant for any
                                         interruption in utilities or services to be provided to the Premises when such
                                         failure is caused by all or any of the following: (a) accident, casualty, breakage
                                         or repairs; (b) strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances or labor disputes of
                                         any such character; (c) governmental regulation, moratorium or other
                                         governmental action; (d) inability, despite the exercise of reasonable diligence,


                                                                Document




                                         to obtain electricity, water or fuel; (e) service interruptions or any other
                                         unavailability of utilities resulting from causes beyond Landlord’s control
                                         including without limitation, any electrical power “brown-out” or “black-out”;
                                         (f) act or default by Tenant or other party; or (g) any other cause beyond
                                         Landlord’s reasonable control. In the event of any stoppage or interruption of
                                         services or utilities which are not obtained directly by Tenant, Landlord shall
                                         diligently attempt to resume such services or utilities as promptly as practicable.
                                         Tenant hereby waives the provisions of any applicable existing or future law,
                                         ordinance or governmental regulation concerning constructive eviction or
                                         permitting the termination of this Lease due to an interruption, failure or
                                         inability to provide any services. If Tenant is prevented from using, and does not
                                         use, the Premises or a substantial portion thereof as a result of any negligent
                                         failure by Landlord to provide utility services to the Premises which Landlord is
                                         obligated to provide pursuant to this Lease, and such failure was not caused
                                         directly or indirectly by the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant, its
                                         employees, agents or visitors, guests, invitees or licensees (an "Abatement
                                         Event"), then Tenant shall give written notice of such Abatement Event to

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                                5







                                         Landlord. If the Abatement Event continues for five (5) consecutive business
                                         days (the "Abatement Period") after Landlord's receipt of Tenant's written notice
                                         of the Abatement Event, then Base Rent shall be abated or reduced after
                                         expiration of the Abatement Period, for such time following expiration of the
                                         Abatement Period that Tenant continues (as a result of the Abatement Event) to
                                         be so prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or a substantial
                                         portion thereof, in the proportion that the rentable area of the portion of the
                                         Premises that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total
                                         rentable area of the Premises.
