                                                form of ACORD 28 (Evidence of Commercial Property Insurance) and
                                                ACORD 25-S (Certificate of Liability Insurance), no later than seven (7)
                                                days after the Effective Date of this Lease (but in any event prior to any
                                                entry onto the Premises by Tenant or any Tenant Party). Tenant shall, at
                                                least ten (10) days prior to expiration of any required coverage, furnish
                                                Landlord with certificates of renewal. Acceptance by Landlord of
                                                delivery of any certificates of insurance does not constitute approval or
                                                agreement by Landlord that the insurance requirements in Section 11.2
                                                have been met, and failure of Landlord to demand such evidence of full
                                                compliance with these insurance requirements or failure of Landlord to
                                                identify a deficiency from evidence provided will not be construed as a
                                                waiver of Tenant’s obligation to maintain such insurance. If Tenant fails
                                                to maintain any insurance required in this Lease, Tenant shall be liable
                                                for all losses and costs suffered or incurred by Landlord (including
                                                litigation costs and attorneys’ fees and expenses) resulting from said
                                                failure. If Tenant fails to deliver any certificate or renewal to Landlord
                                                required under this Lease within the prescribed time period or if any
