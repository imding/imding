Landlord may also perform any obligation of Tenant, without notice to Tenant, should Landlord deem such performance to be an emergency. Any monies expended by Landlord to cure any such Default(s), or resolve any deemed emergency shall be payable by Tenant as Additional Rent. If Landlord incurs any expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in prosecuting and/or defending any action or proceeding by reason of any emergency or default, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for same, as Additional Rent, with interest thereon at eighteen percent (18%) annually from the date such payment is due Landlord
