              Landlord’s reasons for disapproval, or specifying any required corrections. This procedure shall be repeated until
              Landlord approves the amendments or revisions and all Permits have been obtained for the Approved Working
              Drawings, as so amended.

                        3.3 Commencement of Work. At least ten (10) days prior to the commencement of construction of the
              Tenant Improvements, or the delivery of any construction materials for the Tenant Improvement Work to the
              Building, whichever is earlier, Tenant shall submit to Landlord a notice specifying the date Tenant will commence
              construction of the Tenant Improvements, the estimated date of completion of the Tenant Improvements and the
              construction schedule provided by Tenant’s Contractor. In addition, prior to the commencement of construction of
              the Tenant Improvements, or the delivery of any construction materials for the Tenant Improvement Work to the
              Building, whichever is earlier, Tenant shall submit to Landlord the following: (a) all Permits required to commence
              construction of the Tenant Improvements; (b) a copy of the executed construction contract with Tenant’s Contractor,
              in the form previously approved by Landlord, together with a detailed breakdown, by trade, of the final costs to be
              incurred, or which have theretofore been incurred, in connection with the design and construction of the Tenant
              Improvements, which costs of construction form a basis for the amount of the construction contract; and (c) true and
              correct copies of all policies of insurance, or original certificates thereof executed by an authorized agent of the
              insurer or insurers, together with any endorsements referred to in Section 3.5 below, confirming to Landlord’s
              reasonable satisfaction compliance with the insurance requirements of this Work Letter.

                        3.4 Performance of Work. All work performed by Tenant’s Contractor shall strictly conform to the
              Approved Working Drawings, shall comply with all applicable Laws (including building codes) and all applicable
              standards of the American Insurance Association and the National Electrical Code and all building material
              manufacturer’s specifications, shall comply with all rules and regulations from time to time adopted by Landlord to
              govern construction in or about the Project, including the Tenant Construction Rules and Regulations, and shall be
              performed in a good and professional manner and so as not to interfere with the occupancy of any other tenant of the
              Project, the performance of any other work within the Project, or with Landlord’s maintenance or operation of the
              Project. At all times during construction of the Tenant Improvements, Landlord and Landlord’s employees and
              agents shall have the right to enter the Premises to inspect the Tenant Improvement Work, and to require the
              correction of any faulty work or any material deviation from the Approved Working Drawings. Tenant shall not
              close-up any Tenant Improvement Work affecting the Systems in the Premises until the same have been inspected
              and approved by Landlord’s agents. No inspection or approval by Landlord of any such work shall constitute an
              endorsement thereof or any representation as to the adequacy thereof for any purpose or the conformance thereof
              with any Laws, and Tenant shall be fully responsible and liable therefor. In addition to the Construction
              Administration Costs under Section 4.2 below, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of any repairs,
              corrections or restoration which must be made, in Landlord’s good faith judgment, to the Premises or any other
              portion of the Project, if caused by Tenant’s Contractor or any other of Tenant’s Construction Agents.

                        3.5 Insurance. At all times during the construction of the Tenant Improvements (and in the case of Products
              and Completed Operations Coverage, for 5 years following completion of the Tenant Improvement Work), in
              addition to the insurance required to

                                                                      Exhibit B–5






              be maintained by Tenant under the Lease, Tenant shall require all of Tenant’s Construction Agents to maintain
              (a) Commercial General Liability Insurance with limits of not less than $2,000,000 combined single limit for bodily
              injury and property damage, including personal injury and death, and Contractor’s Protective Liability, and Products
              and Completed Operations Coverage in an amount not less than $500,000 per incident, $1,000,000 in the aggregate;
              (b) Comprehensive automobile liability insurance with a policy limit of not less than $1,000,000 each accident for
              bodily injury and property damage, providing coverage at least as broad as the Insurance Services Office
              (ISO) Business Auto Coverage form covering Automobile Liability, code 1 “any auto”, and insuring against all loss
              in connection with the ownership, maintenance and operation of automotive equipment that is owned, hired or non-
              owned; (c) Worker’s Compensation with statutory limits and Employer’s Liability Insurance with limits of not less
              than $100,000 per accident, $500,000 aggregate disease coverage and $100,000 disease coverage per employee. In
              addition, Tenant shall carry “Builder’s All Risk” insurance in an amount approved by Landlord covering the
              construction of the Tenant Improvements, including such extended coverage endorsements as may be reasonably
              required by Landlord. Tenant’s liability insurance shall be written on an “occurrence” basis and shall name
              Landlord’s Insureds as additional insureds (by endorsement reasonably acceptable to Landlord). The “Builder’s All
              Risk” insurance shall name Landlord and such other parties as Landlord may specify as the loss payee(s) with
              respect to all proceeds received therefrom. All of the insurance required to be carried by Tenant hereunder shall
              provide that it is primary insurance, and not excess over or contributory with any other valid, existing, and
              applicable insurance in force for or on behalf of Landlord, shall provide that Landlord shall receive thirty (30) days’
              written notice from the insurer prior to any cancellation or change of coverage, and shall be placed with companies
              which are rated A:X or better by Best’s Insurance Guide and licensed to business in the State of California. All
              deductibles and self-insured retentions under Tenant’s policies are subject to Landlord’s reasonable approval, and all
              insurance, except Workers’ Compensation, maintained by Tenant’s Construction Agents shall preclude subrogation
              claims by the insurer against anyone insured thereunder. Tenant’s compliance with the provisions of this Section
              shall in no way limit Tenant’s liability under any of the other provisions of the Lease.

                        3.6 Liens. Tenant shall keep the Premises and the Project free from any liens arising out of work
              performed, materials furnished or obligations incurred by Tenant. Should Tenant fail to remove any such lien within
              five (5) days after notice to do so from Landlord, Landlord may, in addition to any other remedies, record a bond
              pursuant to California Civil Code Section 3143 and all costs and obligations incurred by Landlord in so doing shall
              immediately become due and payable by Tenant to Landlord as Additional Rent under the Lease. Landlord shall
              have the right to post and keep posted on the Premises any notices that may be required or permitted by Laws, or
              which Landlord may deem to be proper, for the protection of Landlord and the Building from such liens. Promptly
              following completion of construction, Tenant shall provide Landlord a copy of a final unconditional lien release
              from Tenant’s Contractor and each of Tenant’s Construction Agents who performed work or supplied materials for
              the Tenant Improvements. Upon completion of construction, Tenant shall promptly record a Notice of Completion in
              accordance with California Civil Code Section 3093 and provide a copy thereof to Landlord.
