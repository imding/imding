              8. MAINTENANCE; ALTERATIONS.
                    8.1 Landlord Maintenance. Except as provided in this Section 8.1, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair and/or
              maintain the Tenant Space. Landlord will maintain and keep in clean and safe condition, and good order and repair, the Cage,
              Pathway, any Additional Pathway and shared Pathway (including dark fiber(s)) and the Datacenter, including, the Datacenter
              common area, Landlord’s Access Control Systems, HVAC, UPS plant, DC plant (if any), Back-up Power, fire suppression
              systems, common area cable management systems comprised of ladder racks, fiber trays, under-floor cable trays and other
              similar equipment installed for the benefit of all tenants of the Datacenter, floors and walls, foundation, exterior walls and roof
              of the Building, the public areas within the Building, and all common Building Systems, including without limitation, the
              heating, air conditioning and ventilation system within the Building. Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to,
              (i) maintain battery capacity in the UPS plant for Tenant UPS power and the DC plant for DC power (if any), as specified in
              Item 2 of Exhibit “F”, (ii) maintain Datacenter temperature within the range specified in Item 4(a) of Exhibit “F”,
              (iii) maintain Datacenter relative humidity within the range specified in Item 4(b) of Exhibit “F”, and (iv) maintain PDUs
              serving the Tenant Space. In the event of an interruption of electrical service to the Premises, Landlord shall reasonably
              promptly thereafter contract with a third party vendor to provide fuel to the fuel tanks of the Back-up Power systems for the
              duration of such interruption. The cost thereof shall be borne by Tenant if such interruption or failure was caused by any act or
              omission of Tenant or Tenant’s employees, agents, invitees or contractors.

                   8.2 Tenant’s Maintenance. During the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, maintain the
              Tenant Space and Tenant’s equipment therein and in the Datacenter Connection Area, if any, in a clean and safe condition and
              in good order (and in at least as good order and clean condition as when Tenant took possession), ordinary wear and tear
              excepted. If Tenant fails to perform its covenants of maintenance and repair hereunder, or if Tenant or any of Tenant’s
              technicians or representatives physically damages the Property, the Building, the Datacenter, the Datacenter Connection Area,
              or any portion of any of the above, or the personal property of any other tenant or occupant, Landlord may, but shall not be
              obligated to, perform all necessary or appropriate maintenance and repair, and any

                                                                              -10-





              amounts expended by Landlord in connection therewith, plus an administrative charge of ten percent (10%), shall be
              reimbursed by Tenant to Landlord as Additional Rent within thirty (30) days after Landlord’s demand therefor. Aside from
              Tenant’s equipment, if any, in the Datacenter Connection Area, Tenant shall have no obligation to maintain or repair the
              Datacenter Connection Area.

                   8.3 Alterations. Notwithstanding any provision in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not make or cause to be made
              any alterations, additions, improvements or replacements to the Tenant Space, the Datacenter, or any other portion of the
              Building or Property (collectively, “Alterations”) without the prior written consent and approval of Landlord, which consent
              and approval may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that
              Landlord’s consent shall not be required for any usual and customary installations, repairs, maintenance, and removals of
              equipment and telecommunication cables within the Tenant Space if and to the extent that such installations, repairs,
              maintenance, and removals (i) are usual and customary within the industry, (ii) are of a type and extent which are customarily
              permitted to be made without consent by landlords acting consistently with Institutional Owner Practices (defined below)
              leasing similar space for similar uses to similar tenants, (iii) are in compliance with the Datacenter Rules and Regulations, and
              (iv) will not affect the Building’s structure, the provision of services to other Building tenants, or the Building’s electrical,
              plumbing, HVAC, life safety or mechanical systems. For example, Landlord’s consent would be required for the installation of
              overhead ladder racks that are attached to the ceiling and Landlord’s consent would not be required for the installation of
              equipment which does not involve drilling into the floor or ceiling. For purposes hereof, “Institutional Owner Practices” shall
              mean practices that are consistent with the practices of the majority of the institutional owners of institutional grade, first-class
              datacenter or telecommunications projects in the United States of America. Additionally, Landlord and Tenant agree that,
              Landlord shall provided its consent (or objections) with regard to Tenant’s requests for Alterations consent within ten
              (10) business days after Landlord’s receipt of such request. In the event that Landlord has failed to provide its consent (or
              objections) within the prescribed ten (10) business day period, as applicable, Landlord will be deemed to have consented with
              regard to the applicable request for Alterations consent; provided that (i) such request for Alterations consent contains the
              phrase “DATED MATERIAL ENCLOSED. RESPONSE IS REQUIRED WITHIN TEN BUSINESS DAYS AFTER
              LANDLORD’S RECEIPT HEREOF”, in all capital letters (no smaller than sixteen (16) point font) on the outside of the
              package in which such request for Alterations consent is provided to Landlord; (ii) such request for Alterations consent contains
              three (3) full sets of drawings (two full size hard copies, and one full set of drawings on CD); and (iii) in the event that
              Landlord has not responded within such ten (10) business day period, Tenant agrees to provide Landlord one (1) additional
              written notice (the “2nd Alterations Consent Notice”) and one (1) additional business day following such 2nd Alterations
              Consent Notice in which to respond, prior to such deemed consent taking effect.

                   8.4 Removal of Cable, Wiring, Connecting Lines, Equipment and Personal Property. Tenant agrees that, upon the
              expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant (or, failing which, a contractor designated by Landlord) shall at Tenant’s
              sole cost and expense, promptly remove all of Tenant’s Personal Property (defined below), and shall restore those portions of
              the Building, the Datacenter and/or the Tenant Space damaged by such removal of (or by the initial installation of) such
              Tenant’s Personal Property to their condition immediately prior to the installation or placement of such items. If Tenant fails to
              promptly remove any such Tenant’s Personal Property pursuant to this Section 8.4, Landlord shall have the right to remove
              such Tenant’s Personal Property and to restore those portions of the Building, the Datacenter, and/or the Tenant Space damaged
              by such removal to their condition immediately prior to the installation or placement of such Tenant’s Personal Property, in
              which case Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord within thirty (30) days of Landlord’s demand therefor, for all of Landlord’s
              costs of removal and restoration plus an administrative fee equal to ten percent (10%) of such cost. For purposes hereof,
              “Tenant’s Personal Property” shall mean, collectively, all cable, wiring, connecting lines, and other installations, equipment
              or property installed or placed by or for on behalf of Tenant anywhere in the Building, the Datacenter, and/or the Tenant Space.

              9. CASUALTY; EMINENT DOMAIN; INSURANCE.

                                                                              -11-





                   9.1 Casualty; Eminent Domain.
                         9.1.1 If at any time during the Term of this Lease, a material portion of the Property, the Building, the Datacenter or
              the Tenant Space shall be (i) damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty (a “Casualty”), or (ii) taken under the power of
              eminent domain or condemned by any competent authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, or sold to prevent the
              exercise thereof (a “Taking”), so that, in either case, the use of the Tenant Space is materially impaired, then Landlord shall
              have the right to elect, in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion, to either (a) terminate this Lease by delivery of written notice
              (a “Termination Notice”) thereof to Tenant or (b) to continue this Lease, in which case, Landlord shall repair and reconstruct
              the Tenant Space and the Datacenter to substantially the same condition in which they existed immediately prior to such
              Casualty or Taking. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall have no right to terminate the Lease due to Casualty or
              Taking unless it also terminates the Leases of all other tenants of the Building similarly affected by the Casualty or Taking. If as
              a result of the Casualty, the Tenant Space is unfit for use by Tenant in the ordinary conduct of Tenant’s business and actually is
              not used by Tenant in the ordinary conduct of Tenant’s business (which, for the avoidance of doubt, and for the purposes of this
              Lease, means the operation of Tenant’s business in the affected portion of the Tenant Space is adversely impacted), then
              Landlord shall provide written notice (the “Restoration Notice”) to Tenant as soon as practicable after the Casualty of the
              period of time (the “Stated Restoration Period”) which shall be required for the repair and restoration of the Building to
              permit use of the Tenant Space in the ordinary conduct of Tenant’s business and Tenant shall have the right, at its election, to
              terminate this Lease if either (i) the Stated Restoration Period shall be in excess of ninety (90) days following the Casualty and
              Tenant terminates this Lease with written notice thereof to Landlord within ten (10) days following delivery of the Restoration
              Notice, or (ii) Landlord shall fail within the Stated Restoration Period to complete the repair and restoration of the Building
              necessary to allow Tenant’s use of the Tenant Space in the ordinary conduct of Tenant’s business and Tenant delivers written
              notice of such termination to Landlord within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the restoration deadline.

                        9.1.2 Base Rent Abatement. In the event that this Lease is terminated as herein permitted, Landlord shall refund to
              Tenant any prepaid Base Rent less any sum then owing Landlord by Tenant. Landlord shall not be obligated to carry insurance
              on Tenant’s personal property within the Tenant Space. If this Lease is not terminated in pursuant to Section 9.1.1 above, Base
              Rent shall abate proportionately during the period and to the extent that the Tenant Space is unfit for use by Tenant in the
              ordinary conduct of Tenant’s business and actually is not used by Tenant in the ordinary conduct of Tenant’s business, this
              Lease shall continue in full force and effect, and such repairs shall be made within the time periods set forth in Section 9.1.1
              above, subject to delay caused by Force Majeure.

                         9.1.3 Tenant’s Remedy. Tenant’s termination right and Base Rent abatement, to the extent provided above in this
              Article 9, shall be Tenant’s sole remedies in the event of a Casualty or Taking, and Tenant shall not be entitled to any
              compensation or damages for loss of, or interference with, Tenant’s business or use or access of all or any part of the Tenant
              Space resulting from any such damage, repair, reconstruction or restoration; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
              to the contrary herein, if any Casualty is caused by any negligent act or omission or act of willful misconduct of Tenant or any
              Tenant Party, Tenant shall not be entitled to terminate this Lease under Section 9.1.1 and there shall be no abatement of any
              Base Rent (or any other Rent or other amounts) due hereunder.

                         9.1.4 Waiver. Landlord and Tenant agree that the provisions of this Article 9 and the remaining provisions of this
              Lease shall exclusively govern the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to any and all damage to, or destruction of,
              all or any portion of the Tenant Space, the Building or the Property, and/or any Taking thereof, and each Landlord and Tenant
              hereby waive and release each and all of their respective common law and statutory rights inconsistent herewith, whether now
              or hereinafter in effect.

                   9.2 Tenant’s Insurance. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense, procure and maintain throughout the Term of this Lease a
              policy or policies of insurance in accordance with the terms and requirements set forth in Exhibit “B” to this Lease. Tenant
              hereby waives its rights against the Landlord Group (defined in

                                                                              -12-





              Item 24 of the Basic Lease Information) with respect to any claims or damages or losses (including any claims for bodily injury
              to persons and/or damage to property) which are caused by or result from (i) risks insured against under any insurance policy
              carried by Tenant at the time of such claim, damage, loss or injury, or (ii) risks which would have been covered under any
              insurance required to be obtained and maintained by Tenant under this Lease had such insurance been obtained and maintained
              as required; provided, however, that in no event shall Tenant be deemed to have waived its right against Landlord with respect
              to any claims or damages or losses (including any claims for bodily injury to persons and/or damage to property) which are
              caused by or result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any member of the Landlord Group. The foregoing
              waivers shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, any other waivers or releases contained in this Lease and shall survive
              expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. All of Tenant’s insurance policies shall be endorsed so as to include a waiver of
              subrogation with and to the full extent of Tenant’s waiver of claims above.

                    9.3 Landlord’s Insurance. Landlord shall, at Landlord’s expense, procure and maintain throughout the Term of this
              Lease a policy or policies of insurance insuring the Building and the Property and all of Landlord’s equipment and fixtures
              installed therein against loss due to fire and other casualties included in standard extended coverage insurance policies, in an
              amount equal to the replacement cost thereof. Landlord shall also maintain such insurance as is customarily carried by
              reasonably prudent landlords of datacenters in the city in which the Property is located. All insurance required under this Lease
              shall be issued by insurers with a “General Policyholders Rating” of at least A-, VIII, as set forth in “Best’s Insurance Guide.”
              Such insurers shall be authorized to do business in the state in which the Property is located. Landlord hereby waives its rights
              against Tenant with respect to any claims or damages or losses (including any claims for bodily injury to persons and/or
              damage to property) which are caused by or result from (i) risks insured against under any insurance policy carried by Landlord
              at the time of such claim, damage, loss or injury, or (ii) risks which would have been covered under any insurance required to
              be obtained and maintained by Landlord under this Lease had such insurance been obtained and maintained as required;
              provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord be deemed to have waived its rights against Tenant with respect to any
              claims or damages or losses (including any claims for bodily injury to persons and/or damage to property) which are caused by
              or result from the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant and/or the Tenant Parties, as defined in Section 14.2 below. The
              foregoing waivers shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, any other waivers or releases contained in this Lease. All of
              Landlord’s insurance policies shall be endorsed so as to include a waiver of subrogation with and to the full extent of
              Landlord’s waiver of claims above.
