              15. TENANT’S INSURANCE
                   (a) Commercial General Liability Insurance. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense, secure and keep in force a
              “broad form” commercial general liability insurance and property damage policy covering the Premises, insuring
              Tenant, and naming Landlord, Landlord’s investment advisors, property managers and agents from time to time,
              including, without limitation, UBS Realty Investors LLC, and Landlord’s lenders as additional insureds
              (collectively, “Landlord’s Insureds”) against any liability arising out of the ownership, use,

  

              occupancy or maintenance of the Premises. The minimum limit of coverage of such policy shall be in the amount of
              not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) for injury or death of one person in any one accident or
              occurrence and in the amount of not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) for injury or death of more than
              one person in any one accident or occurrence, shall include an extended liability endorsement providing contractual
              liability coverage (which shall include coverage for Tenant’s indemnification obligations in this Lease), and shall
              contain a severability of interest clause or a cross liability endorsement. Such insurance shall further insure Landlord
              and Tenant against liability for property damage of at least Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00). Landlord may
              from time to time require reasonable increases in any such limits if Landlord believes that additional coverage is
              necessary or desirable. The limit of any insurance shall not limit the liability of Tenant hereunder. No policy
              maintained by Tenant under this Paragraph 15(a) shall contain a deductible greater than five thousand dollars
              ($5,000.00). No policy shall be cancelable or subject to reduction of coverage without thirty (30) days prior written
              notice to Landlord (except in the event of cancellation as a result of nonpayment, in which case the insurer shall give

              coverage and rated B+:XIII or better in Best’s Key Rating Guide. The amount of liability coverage required
              hereunder may be achieved by Tenant’s obtaining excess liability or “umbrella” policies to supplement its primary
              policy.

                    (b) Personal Property Insurance. Tenant shall maintain in full force and effect on all of its personal property,
              furniture, furnishings, trade or business fixtures and equipment (collectively, “Tenant’s Property”) on the Premises,
              a policy or policies of fire and extended coverage insurance with standard coverage endorsement to the extent of the
              full replacement cost thereof No such policy shall contain a deductible greater than five thousand dollars
              ($5,000.00). During the term of this Lease the proceeds from any such policy or policies of insurance shall be used
              for the repair or replacement of the fixtures and equipment so insured. Landlord shall have no interest in the
              insurance upon Tenant’s equipment and fixtures and will sign all documents reasonably necessary in connection
              with the settlement of any claim or loss by Tenant. Landlord will not carry insurance on Tenant’s possessions.

                   (c) Worker’s Compensation Insurance; Employer’s Liability Insurance. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense,
              maintain in full force and effect worker’s compensation insurance with not less than the minimum limits required by
              law, and employer’s liability insurance with a minimum limit of coverage of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000).

                   (d) Evidence of Coverage. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord certificates of insurance and true and complete
              copies of any and all endorsements required herein for all insurance required to be maintained by Tenant hereunder
              at the time of execution of this Lease by Tenant. Tenant shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of each
              policy, furnish Landlord with certificates of renewal thereof. Each certificate shall expressly provide that such
              policies shall not be cancelable or otherwise subject to modification except after thirty (30) days prior written notice
              to Landlord and the other parties named as additional insureds as required in this Lease (except for cancellation for
              nonpayment of premium, in which event cancellation shall not take effect until at least ten (10) days notice has been
              given to Landlord).

 


              16. INDEMNIFICATION
                   (a) Of Landlord. Tenant shall defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless Landlord and Landlord’s Agents
              against and from any and all claims, suits, liabilities, judgments, costs, demands, causes of action and expenses
              (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements) arising from (1) the use of the
              Premises, the Building or the Project by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents, or from any activity done, permitted or suffered
              by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents in or about the Premises, the Building or the Project, and (2) any act, neglect, fault,
              willful misconduct or omission of Tenant or Tenant’s Agents, or from any breach or default in the terms of this
              Lease by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents, and (3) any action or proceeding brought on account of any matter in items
              (1) or (2). If any action or proceeding is brought against Landlord by reason of any such claim, upon notice from
              Landlord, Tenant shall defend the same at Tenant’s expense by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord. As a
              material part of the consideration to Landlord, Tenant hereby releases Landlord and Landlord’s Agents from
              responsibility for, waives its entire claim of recovery for and assumes all risk of (i) damage to property or injury to
              persons in or about the Premises, the Building or the Project from any cause whatsoever (except to the extent is
              caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or Landlord’s Agents or by the failure of Landlord
              to observe any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, if such failure has persisted for an unreasonable period of
              time after written notice of such failure), or (ii) loss resulting from business interruption or loss of income at the
              Premises. The obligations of Tenant under this Paragraph 16 shall survive any termination of this Lease.

                   (b) No Impairment of Insurance. The foregoing indemnity shall not relieve any insurance carrier of its
              obligations under any policies required to be carried by either party pursuant to this Lease, to the extent that such
              policies cover the peril or occurrence that results in the claim that is subject to the foregoing indemnity.
