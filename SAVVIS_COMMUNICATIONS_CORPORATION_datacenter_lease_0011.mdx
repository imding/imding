              Building or the Property.

                   11.2 At any time and from time to time, within ten (10) days after written request by Tenant, Landlord shall
              execute, acknowledge and deliver to Tenant a statement in writing certifying all matters reasonably requested by

                                                           Data Center Lease




              11 may be relied upon by any current or prospective transferee, purchaser of Tenant, lender to Tenant or transferee,

                                                                           -19-

              12. SUBORDINATION AND ATTORNMENT; LENDER RIGHTS.
                   12.1 Subordination and Attornment. Without the necessity of any additional document being executed by
              Tenant for the purpose of effecting a subordination, and at the election of Landlord or any mortgagee or beneficiary
              with a mortgage deed or deed of trust encumbering the Property or any portion thereof, or any lessor of a ground or
              underlying lease with respect to the Property or any portion thereof (any such mortgagee, beneficiary or lessor, a
              “Holder”), this Lease will be subject and subordinate at all times to: (i) all ground leases or underlying leases which
              may now exist or hereafter be executed affecting the Property; (ii) the lien of any mortgage, deed or deed of trust
              which may now exist or hereafter be executed for which the Property or any portion thereof; (iii) all past and future
              advances made under any such mortgages, deeds or deeds of trust; and (iv) all renewals, modifications,
              replacements and extensions of any such ground leases, master leases, mortgages, deed and deeds of trust
              (collectively, “Security Documents”) which may now exist or hereafter be executed which constitute a lien upon or
              affect the Property or any portion thereof, or Landlord’s interest and estate in any of said items. Notwithstanding the
              foregoing, Landlord reserves the right to subordinate any such Security Documents to this Lease. In the event of any
              termination or transfer of Landlord’s estate or interest in the Property, the Building, or the Tenant Space by reason of
              any termination or foreclosure of any such Security Documents (and notwithstanding any subordination of such
              Security Document to this Lease that may or may not have occurred), at the election of Landlord’s successor in
              interest, Tenant agrees to attorn to and become the tenant of such successor, in which event Tenant’s right to
              possession of the Property will not be disturbed as long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease. Tenant hereby
              waives any right under any Applicable Law or otherwise to terminate or otherwise adversely affect this Lease and
              the obligations of Tenant hereunder in the event of any termination or transfer of Landlord’s estate or interest in the
              Property, the Building, or the Tenant Space by reason of any termination or foreclosure of any such Security
              Documents. Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver, within ten (10) days of receipt thereof, and in the
              form reasonably required by Landlord or in the standard form required by any Holder, any additional documents
              evidencing the priority or subordination of this Lease and Tenant’s agreement to attorn with respect to any such
              Security Document; provided, however, (aa) any such agreement subordinating this Lease to such lease, mortgage or
              deed of trust shall contain a nondisturbance provision in the standard form of such Holder; and (bb) Landlord agrees
              that, in connection (and contemporaneously) with Landlord’s placing of debt on the Property, Landlord shall obtain
              and deliver a Subordination and Non-Disturbance Agreement, as it relates to this Lease, from Landlord’s lender in
              the form reasonably required by such lender.

                   12.2 Mortgage and Ground Lessor Protection. Tenant agrees to give each Holder, by registered or certified
              mail, a copy of any notice of default served upon the Landlord by Tenant, provided that prior to such notice Tenant
              has been notified in writing of the address of such Holder (hereafter, a “Noticed Holder”). Tenant further agrees that
              if Landlord shall have failed to cure such default within thirty (30) days after such notice to Landlord (or if such
              default cannot be cured or corrected within that time, then within such additional time (not to exceed ninety
              (90) days in total) as may be necessary if Landlord has commenced such cure within such thirty (30) days and is
              diligently pursuing the remedies or steps necessary to cure or correct such default), then prior to Tenant pursuing any
              remedy for such default provided hereunder, at law or in equity, any Noticed Holder shall have an additional thirty
              (30) days within which to cure or correct such default (or if such default cannot reasonably be cured or corrected
              within that time, then such additional time (not to exceed sixty (60) days in total) as may be necessary if the Noticed
              Holder has commenced within such thirty (30) days and is diligently pursuing the remedies or steps necessary to
              cure or correct such default). For the avoidance of doubt, Landlord and Tenant agree that (i) the aforementioned
              notice and cure periods shall run concurrently with the Section 16.1 notice and cure periods; and (ii) nothing herein
              shall operate to extend the period of time for Landlord’s monetary obligations contained herein.

                                                                           -20-
                                                                Data Center Lease




                                                                                                                                 Page

                   12.3 SNDA. At any time that the Building is made subject to any Security Document(s), Landlord shall use
              commercially reasonable good faith efforts to cause the mortgagee and any lessor (whether under a ground or master
              lease) to deliver to Tenant a subordination, attornment and non-disturbance agreement reasonably acceptable to
              Tenant (the “SNDA”), providing that so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease after the expiration of any
              applicable notice and cure periods, Tenant may remain in possession of the Tenant Space under the terms of this
              Lease, even if the mortgagee or its successor should acquire Landlord’s title to the Building. Notwithstanding
              anything herein to the contrary, the subordination of this Lease to any Security Document now or hereafter placed
              upon the Building and Tenant’s agreement to attorn to the holder as provided in this Section 12 shall be conditioned
              upon the holder entering into a SNDA.

                   12.4 Tenant’s Lender. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge (a) that Tenant will, in all likelihood, finance all or a
              portion of the Alterations and Tenant’s Personal Property; and (b) that, in connection with such financing, Tenant’s
              lender (whether one or more, collectively, “Tenant’s Lender”) will be granted a lien on all or a part of Tenant’s
              Personal Property and/or Alterations. In connection with such financing, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that
              Tenant’s Lender’s rights, duties and obligations with regard to the Alterations and Tenant’s Personal Property shall
              be governed, primarily, by the terms of, that certain Collateral Access Agreement (the “CAA”), attached hereto as
              Exhibit “K”, which Landlord and Tenant agree to execute contemporaneously with the execution of this Lease.
              Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that, to the extent that this Lease and the CAA conflict, the CAA shall govern and
              control. Additionally, Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Tenant has no right to pledge or collaterally assign, and
              Tenant’s Lender will have no right to lien, Tenant’s leasehold interest hereunder. If Tenant shall refinance its existing
              loan, Landlord shall enter into a collateral access agreement with the refinance lender designated by Tenant on
              substantially similar terms and conditions as those set forth in the CAA attached hereto as Exhibit “K”.
