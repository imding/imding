              17. MISCELLANEOUS.

                                                                              -20-


                  17.1 Severability. If any provision of this Lease is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
              unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby.

                   17.2 Performance. The covenants and obligations of Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall be independent of performance
              by Landlord of the covenants and obligations of Landlord pursuant to this Lease. Tenant’s performance of each of its
              obligations under this Lease shall be a condition precedent to the duty of Landlord to perform its obligations hereunder.

                    17.3 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. If either Landlord or Tenant initiates any litigation, mediation, arbitration or other
              proceeding regarding the enforcement, construction or interpretation of this Lease, then the non-prevailing party shall pay the
              prevailing party’s attorneys’ fees and costs (including, without limitation, all expense reimbursements, expert witness fees and
              litigation costs). In addition, if it should otherwise be necessary or proper for Landlord to consult an attorney concerning this
              Lease for the review of instruments evidencing a proposed Transfer, for the purpose of collecting Rent, Tenant agrees to pay to
              Landlord its actual attorneys’ fees whether suit be brought or not to the extent such fees exceed $500.00.

                  17.4 Waiver of Right to Jury Trial. IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE COST OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN
              THE PARTIES, AND AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS LEASE, TO THE
              FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LANDLORD AND TENANT EACH EXPRESSLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO
              TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY TRIAL HELD AS A RESULT OF A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR
              IN ANY MANNER RELATED TO THIS LEASE IN WHICH LANDLORD AND TENANT ARE ADVERSE PARTIES. THE
              FILING OF A CROSS-COMPLAINT BY ONE AGAINST THE OTHER IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE PARTIES
              “ADVERSE.”

                   17.5 Headings; Time; Survival. The headings of the Articles, Sections and Exhibits of this Lease are for convenience
              only and do not define, limit or construe the contents thereof. Words of any gender used in this Lease shall be held and
              construed to include any other gender, and words in the singular number shall be held to include the plural, unless the context
              otherwise requires. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has read and reviewed this Lease and that it has had the
              opportunity to confer with counsel in the negotiation of this Lease. Accordingly, this Lease shall be construed neither for nor
              against Landlord or Tenant, but shall be given a fair and reasonable interpretation in accordance with the meaning of its terms
              and the intent of the parties. In all instances where Tenant is required to pay any sum or do any act at a particular indicated time
              or within an indicated period, it is understood that time is of the essence. Any obligations of Tenant accruing prior to the
              expiration or termination of this Lease shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease, and Tenant shall promptly
              perform all such obligations whether or not this Lease has expired.

                    17.6 Notices. Any notice which may or shall be given under the provisions of this Lease shall be in writing and may be
              delivered by (i) by hand delivery or personal service, (ii) by a reputable overnight courier service which provides evidence of
              delivery, (iii) by facsimile (so long as a confirming copy is forwarded by a reputable overnight courier service within twenty-
              four (24) hours thereafter), or (iv) by email (so long as a confirming copy is forwarded by a reputable overnight courier service
              within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), if for Landlord, to the Building office and at the address specified in Item 16 of the
              Basic Lease Information, or if for Tenant, at the address specified in Item 3 of the Basic Lease Information, or at such other
              addresses as either party may have theretofore specified by written notice delivered in accordance herewith. Such address may
              be changed from time to time by either party by giving notice as provided herein. Notice shall be deemed given, (a) when
              delivered (if delivered by hand or personal service), (b) if sent by a reputable overnight courier service, on the business day
              immediately following the business day on which it was sent, (c) the date the facsimile is transmitted, or (d) the date the e-mail
              is transmitted. If the term Tenant as used in this Lease refers to more than one (1) person and/or entity, and notice given as
              aforesaid to any one of such persons and/or entities shall be deemed to have been duly given to Tenant. Notwithstanding any
              provision of this Lease to the contrary, in the case where

                                                                              -21-

              statutory law requires that any notice, notice to quit or pay rent, summons or complaint (or any other form of writing required
              in connection with the assertion of rights against Tenant, the enforcement of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease or the
              termination of Tenant’s rights hereunder) (collectively, “Statutory Written Notices or Complaints”) must be delivered or
              served in a particular form, delivered to or served on Tenant through delivery to or service on a particular representative of
              Tenant, delivered or served in a particular manner (or by a particular method), for purposes of determining compliance with
              such applicable statutory requirements, the time, manner or method of delivery of all such Statutory Written Notices or
              Complaints delivered to or served on all of the Tenant addressees for notices listed in Item 3 of the Basic Lease Information
              (other than the timing, manner and/or method of delivery of the Statutory Written Notice or Complaint to the first addressee
              listed in Item 3 of the Basic Lease Information) shall be disregarded, and if the timing, manner and, method of delivery and
              form of the Statutory Written Notice or Complaint delivered to the first addressee listed in Item 3 of the Basic Lease
              Information shall satisfy the applicable statutory requirements, then such statutory requirements shall be deemed satisfied with
              respect to the timing, manner, and method of delivery and form with respect to all Tenant addressees as of the date of delivery
              to such first addressee.

                    17.7 Governing Law; No Counterclaim; Jurisdiction. This Lease shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
              with, the laws of the state in which the Property is located. It is mutually agreed that in the event Landlord commences any
              summary proceeding for non-payment of Rent, Tenant will not interpose any counterclaim (other than any compulsory
              counterclaims) of whatever nature or description in any such proceeding. The foregoing shall not be construed to prevent
              Tenant from bringing a separate action related to such counterclaims. In addition, Tenant hereby submits to local jurisdiction in
              the state in which the Property is located and agrees that any action by Tenant against Landlord shall be instituted in the state in
              which the Property is located and that Landlord shall have personal jurisdiction over Tenant for any action brought by Landlord
              against Tenant in the state in which the Property is located.

                   17.8 Incorporation; Amendment; Merger. This Lease, along with any exhibits and attachments or other documents
              referred to herein, all of which are hereby incorporated into this Lease by this reference, constitutes the entire and exclusive
              agreement between Landlord and Tenant relating to the Tenant Space, the Datacenter Connection Area and the Datacenter, and
              each of the aforementioned documents may be altered, amended or revoked only by an instrument in writing signed by the
              party to be charged thereby. All prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, understandings and/or practices relative to the
              leasing or use of the Tenant Space, the Datacenter Connection Area or the Datacenter are merged herein or revoked hereby.

                    17.9 Brokers. Each party hereto represents to the other that the representing party has not engaged, dealt with or been
              represented by any broker in connection with this Lease other than the brokers specified in Item 18 of the Basic Lease
              Information. Landlord and Tenant shall each indemnify, defend (with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the other) and hold
              harmless the other party from and against all Claims (including attorneys’ fees and all litigation expenses) related to any claim
              made by any other person or entity for any commission or other compensation in connection with the execution of this Lease or
              the leasing of the Tenant Space to Tenant if based on an allegation that claimant dealt through the indemnifying party. The
              provisions of this Section 17.9 shall survive the termination of this Lease.

                   17.10 Examination of Lease. This Lease shall not be binding or effective until each of the parties hereto have executed
              and delivered an original or counterpart hereof to each other.

                   17.11 Recordation. Neither Tenant nor any person or entity acting through, under or on behalf of Tenant shall record or
              cause the recordation of this Lease, a short form memorandum of this Lease or any reference to this Lease.

              behalf is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Lease pursuant to their respective by-laws, operating agreement, resolution
              or other legally sufficient authority. Further, each party represents to the other party that (i) if it is a partnership, the
              undersigned are all of its general



              partners, (ii) it has been validly formed or incorporated, (iii) it is duly qualified to do business in the state in which the Property
              is located, and (iv) this Lease is being executed on its behalf and for its benefit.

              of this Lease shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal
              representatives and permitted successors and assigns.

                   17.14 Force Majeure. A party shall incur no liability to the other party with respect to, and shall not be responsible for
              any failure to perform, any of its obligations hereunder (other than payment obligations or obligations that may be cured by the
              payment of money (e.g., maintaining insurance)) if such failure is caused by any reason beyond the reasonable control of the
              party obligated to perform such obligations, including, but not limited to, strike, labor trouble, governmental rule, regulations,
              ordinance, statute or interpretation, or by fire, earthquake, civil commotion, or failure or disruption of utility services
              (collectively, “Force Majeure”). The amount of time for a party to perform any of its obligations (other than payment
              obligations) shall be extended by the amount of time it is delayed in performing such obligation by reason or any force majeure
              occurrence whether similar to or different from the foregoing types of occurrences.

                    17.15 No Partnership or Joint Venture; No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be
              deemed or construed to create the relationship of principal and agent, or partnership, or joint venturer, or any other relationship
              between Landlord and Tenant other than landlord and tenant. Landlord shall have no obligations hereunder to any person or
              entity other than Tenant or any person or entity claiming through Tenant, and no other parties shall have any rights hereunder as
              against Landlord.

                    17.16 Access by Landlord. Landlord, Landlord’s agents and employees shall have the right to enter upon any and all
              parts of the Tenant Space at any reasonable time upon prior reasonable oral or written notice (except in the case of an
              emergency when no prior notice shall be required) to examine the condition thereof, to clean, to make any repairs, alterations
              or additions required to be made by Landlord hereunder, to show the Tenant Space to prospective purchasers or tenants or
              mortgage lenders (prospective or current), to determine whether Tenant is complying with all of its obligations under this
              Lease, to exercise any of Landlord’s rights or remedies hereunder and for any reasonable purpose. In connection with
              Landlord’s rights hereunder, Landlord shall at all times have and retain a key with which to unlock all of the doors in, on or
              about the Tenant Space, and Landlord shall have the right to use any and all means by which Landlord may deem proper to
              open such doors to obtain entry to the Tenant Space. Tenant hereby waives any claim for damages for any injury to Tenant’s
              business or inconvenience to, or interference with, Tenant’s business, any loss of occupancy or quiet enjoyment of the Tenant
              Space or any other loss occasioned by such entry, and Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement or reduction of Rent by
              reason thereof, and no such entry to the Tenant Space shall be deemed or construed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into or a
              detainer of the Tenant Space or an eviction, actual or constructive, of Tenant from any part of the Tenant Space.
              Notwithstanding anything in Sections 17.16 and 17.17, any rules or regulations promulgated by Landlord or any maintenance
              schedule relative to Landlord’s access to the Tenant Space to the contrary, Landlord agrees that (except in the case of an
              emergency) Landlord’s access to the Premises shall be subject to Landlord’s compliance with the procedures required by
              Tenant (“Tenant’s Security Procedures”), provided that (i) Landlord has received notice of Tenant’s Security Procedures and
              any changes thereof, and (ii) Tenant’s Security Procedures (as amended from time to time by Tenant) do not unreasonably
              interfere with Landlord’s ability to perform, or increase the cost to Landlord to perform, Landlord’s obligations under this
              Lease or any other lease demising premises in the Building. Tenant shall deliver written notice of the changes to Tenant’s
              Security Procedures to Landlord at Landlord’s address for notices as provided herein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
              contrary, except for emergencies, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to minimize disruption of Tenant’s business or
              occupancy during such entries.

                   17.17 Rights Reserved by Landlord. Landlord reserves the following rights exercisable without notice (except as
              otherwise expressly provided to the contrary in this Lease) and without being, deemed an eviction or disturbance of Tenant’s
              use or possession of the Tenant Space or giving rise to any

              Property and to create such other tenancies in the Datacenter, the Building and the Property as Landlord, in its sole business
              judgment, shall determine is in the best interests of the Property (and Landlord does not represent and Tenant does not rely
              upon any specific type or number of tenants occupying any space in the Datacenter, the Building and the Property during the
              Term of this Lease).

              each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same Lease. Landlord and Tenant agree
              that the delivery of an executed copy of this Lease by facsimile shall be legal and binding and shall have the same full force
              and effect as if an original executed copy of this Lease had been delivered.

                                                             INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS

              Requirements:
              All insurance required under this Lease shall be issued by insurers with a “General Policyholders Rating” of at least A-, VII, as
              set forth in “Best’s Insurance Guide.” Such insurers shall be authorized to do business in the state in which the Property is
              located. The commercial general liability policies procured hereunder shall name the Landlord Group (as defined in the Basic
              Lease Information) and Landlord’s managing agent, and any Holders of any Security Documents designated by Landlord as
              additional insureds. Prior to occupying the Tenant Space and upon subsequent requests of Landlord, Tenant shall submit to
