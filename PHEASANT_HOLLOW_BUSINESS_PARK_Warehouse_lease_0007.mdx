1. `ASSIGNMENT`

23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

16.01           Assignment:     Tenant shall have the right to assign this Lease, in whole or in part, or permit the use of the Premises by licensees, concessionaires or persons other than Tenant, or sublet the Premises, or any part thereof, with Landlord’s consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Landlord hereby consents to Tenant’s partial sublease of a portion of the Premises to PCM Ventures I, LLC (“KwikMed”) and/or Bella Brands, LLC (“Bella”).  Tenant shall not mortgage or hypothecate this Lease, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Landlord in each instance, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

16.02           Consent Required:   Any attempted assignment, subletting, mortgage or hypothecation without Landlord’s consent shall be void, shall confer no benefit on any third party and shall constitute a default hereunder.  Consent to any such transfer of interest shall not operate as a waiver of the necessity
for consent to any subsequent transfer of interest, and the terms of such consent shall be binding upon any person holding by, under, or through Tenant.  Without limiting the ability of Landlord to refuse to consent to a proposed transfer of interest for some other reason, it is understood that Landlord may not give such consent because the proposed transferee may have a financial net worth, managerial skill or operational or business history which is inferior to that of Tenant; or because the character and reputation or the proposed transferee is not satisfactory to Landlord; or because the proposed transferee is not sufficiently experienced in the use permitted by Section 8.01 above.  Landlord may condition the giving of its consent on reasonable modifications to this Lease which the circumstances may then require.  In addition, except with respect to the partial subleases with KwikMed and/or Bella permitted by section 16.01 above, in the event Tenant makes a permitted transfer of interest hereunder upon terms which result in Tenant receiving a lump sum rent consideration for such transfer or is receiving periodic payments of rent consideration which are greater than the rent and other periodic sums which are due Landlord under this Lease, Tenant hereby assigns and shall promptly pay to Landlord fifty percent 50% of the excess rent consideration as such is received.

16.03           Request for Consent:     Should Tenant desire Landlord’s consent to a proposed transfer of interest, Tenant shall request such consent in writing and Tenant will provide Landlord with a statement, certified to be true and correct by Tenant, of the terms and conditions under which such transfer is to be made.  Any instruments used to document such transfer shall include language acknowledging the rights of Landlord described in Section 16.04 below and if the transferee is an assignee of Tenant’s interest in this Lease, also acknowledging that such assignee specifically assumes the obligations of Tenant hereunder.  Except with respect to the KwikMed and Bella assignments and/or subleases, in the event that Landlord shall consent to an assignment, sublease or other transfer of interest, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of Five Hundred Dollars and No Cents ($500.00), the “assignment fee”, to cover costs incurred in preparing and processing the instruments necessary to document such consent.  Notwithstanding any such assignment or other transfer of interest, it is specifically understood that the assigning or transferring Tenant shall continue to be fully responsible for all of the Tenant obligations hereunder until the expiration of the Term.

16.04           Landlord’s Rights in the Event of a Transfer of Interest:     If this Lease is assigned or if the Premises or any portion thereof are sublet or occupied by any person other than Tenant, with or without the consent of Landlord, Landlord may, upon demand, in the event of a default by Tenant under this Lease, collect rent and other charges from such assignee, sub lessee or other person, and apply the amount collected to the rent and other charges due from Tenant hereunder, but such collection shall not

23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

constitute the recognition of such assignee, sub lessee, or other person as the Tenant hereunder or a release of Tenant from the further performance of all of the covenants and obligations of Tenant herein contained.  In the event such assignee, sub lessee or other person pays rent or other charges directly to Landlord pursuant to this Section, the amount so paid shall be credited against the sums due from such person to Tenant under any then existing sublease, lease assignment or other agreement.
