              1.0 THE PURPOSE OF THESE STANDARDS
                   A.    This section applies to single and multi-tenant locations that are managed and operated by Digital Realty
                         Trust or their providers. Locations where tenants manage their sites, these Rules and Regulations are highly
                         recommended, but are not required.
                   B.    To help you work in the Datacenter Room, we need to provide you with the following:
                         (i)     An awareness of the critical nature of the Datacenter Room environment;
                         (ii)    These rules and regulations must be followed when working at these sites
                         (iii)   The extra care you must take in performing all activities, even the most routine duties
                         (iv)    Who to call before you start and if you encounter a problem
                         (v)     Help you achieve your goal of NO UNPLANNED OUTAGES

              2.0 DEFINITION OF A CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT
                   A.    A critical environment consists of all areas, rooms, systems and equipment associated with network operations.
                         These include the UPS modules, chilled water, electrical distribution systems, and the computer equipment that
                         depends on it.
                   B.    The term critical refers to the need to maintain continuous up-time for all primary systems: 24 hours a day; 7
                         days a week, 365 days a year.

              3.0 GENERAL RULES
                   A.    Vendors are not allowed into the Datacenter without prior notification and approval from the tenant. It is the tenant’s
                         responsibility to inform Building Management and Security.
                   B.    If you observe any problems with doors not closing properly or you notice any other possible security concern, be
                         sure to report the issue to Building Security promptly.

                                                                               -1-





                   C.   Cameras, video equipment or visitors are not allowed in the Datacenter unless specifically authorized to do so by the
                        tenant. It is the tenant’s responsibility to inform Building Management and Security.
                   D.   This is a ‘no smoking facility’. Smoking is allowed outside in marked areas only.
                   E.   No food or drink is allowed in the Datacenter at any time.
                   F.   Tampering with the access control systems, camera equipment, or fire alarm/smoke detectors within the building is

                        occur in the Building Meet-Me Room.

              4.0 GUIDELINES ON WHEN TO INVOLVE BUILDING MANAGEMENT
                   This section highlights the most common reasons for Tenants to involve Building Management personnel. This list is
                   intended as a quick reference guide only and by no means is all inclusive. If there are any doubts concerning any
                   operations parameters within the Datacenter, you should contact Building Management.
                   A.   VENDORS. Vendor access requires 12-hour prior notice with detail of activity to be performed by the vendors[;
                        provided, however, that the prior notice requirement shall be “6-hours prior notice” in the event of an emergency
                        situation in the Datacenter]*. Requests for clearance can be no more than one-week at a time. For a multiple week
                        project, a new request is required each week. See SAMPLE VENDOR AUTHORIZATION REQUEST EMAIL at
                        the end of this document.
                        *     Landlord agrees not to modify the bracketed portion of this item 4.0A, as it relates to Tenant and/or the Tenant
                              Space, during the Term of the Lease without Tenant’s prior approval, which approval may be withheld in
                              Tenant’s sole and absolute discretion.
                   B.   SMOKE, ODOR, DUSTY WORK INCLUDING HEAT GUNS. Requires 24-hour advanced notification to allow
                        for disabling of the Fire Suppression System by Building Engineering ONLY. See SAMPLE VENDOR
                        AUTHORIZATION REQUEST EMAIL at the end of this document.
                   C.   ACCESS FOR EMPLOYEES. In addition to the initial Datacenter access list each Tenant shall provide updates for,
                        any changes in personnel that require access to the Datacenter. The information must be provided to Building
                        Management prior to the employee’s entry into the Datacenter. Be advised that, biometric readers will require
                        programming prior to first-time entry. It will be the sole responsibility of the Tenant to inform Building Management
                        of any personnel they wish have removed from the approved access list.

                                                                             2




                   D.   POWER TURN-UP. Requires 24-hour prior notice for Building Engineering to inspect electrical connectivity and
                        activate breakers[; provided, however, that the prior notice requirement shall be “6-hours prior notice” in the event of
                        an emergency situation in the Datacenter]*.
                        *     Landlord agrees not to modify the bracketed portion of this item 4.0D, as it relates to Tenant and/or the Tenant
                              Space, during the Term of the Lease without Tenant’s prior approval, which approval may be withheld in
                              Tenant’s sole and absolute discretion.
