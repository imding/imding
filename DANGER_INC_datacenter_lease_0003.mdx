                                                           STANDARD LEASE PROVISIONS

              1. LEASE OF PREMISES.
                    1.1 Tenant Space. In consideration of the covenants and agreements to be performed by Tenant, and upon and subject to
              the terms and conditions of this Lease, Landlord hereby leases to Tenant for the Term (defined in Section 2.1, below), (i) that
              certain space in the cage(s) specified in Item 7(a) of the Basic Lease Information in the approximate locations depicted on
              Exhibit “A” attached hereto (the “Premises”) and (ii) those certain conduit(s) , partial conduit(s) and/or dark fiber(s) or copper
              described in Item 7(b) of the Basic Lease Information (the “Pathway”). The Premises and the Pathway shall be referred to
              herein collectively as the “Tenant Space.”

                    1.2 Condition of Tenant Space. Tenant has inspected the Datacenter and the Tenant Space and, subject to Landlord’s
              completion of Landlord’s Installations, Tenant accepts the Tenant Space in its “AS IS, WHERE IS” condition. Tenant
              acknowledges and agrees that (i) no representation or warranty (express or implied) has been made by Landlord as to the
              condition of the Property, the Building, the Datacenter or the Tenant Space or their suitability or fitness for the conduct of
              Tenant’s Permitted Use, its business or for any other purpose, except as expressly provided herein, and (ii) except as
              specifically set forth herein, Landlord shall have no obligation to construct or install any improvements in or to make any other
              alterations or modifications to the Tenant Space. Upon the completion of the Commencement Date Conditions, the taking of
              possession of the Tenant Space by Tenant (i.e. Tenant is not considered to be “in possession of the Tenant Space” during any
              period of Early Access (defined below)) shall conclusively establish that the Tenant Space was at such time in good order and
              clean condition.

                    1.3 Datacenter Connection Area. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that all interconnections between the systems of
              Tenant and those of other tenants of the Datacenter and/or the Building must be made in the Meet-Me Room. During the Term
              of this Lease and subject to availability, Tenant shall have the right to lease Additional Pathway between the Datacenter
              Connection Area and the Meet-Me Room upon Landlord’s then prevailing standard rates and terms for such Additional
              Pathway. Tenant acknowledges that the Datacenter Connection Area is a common use area that will be used by and be
              accessible by other tenants and their technicians. The foregoing notwithstanding, Tenant acknowledges that the Meet-Me Room
              is operated by an entity (not an affiliate of Landlord) named telX – Phoenix, LLC (“telx”). All operations in the Meet-Me Room
              (including all MMR Services, as defined in Section 6.1, below), and all Tenant presence, including pathway, in the Meet-Me
              Room (other than connections made in Landlord’s Meet-Me Room interconnection rack) are governed and controlled by telx;
              each and all of which is subject to such agreements and costs as are required, from time to time, by telx.

                   1.4 Intentionally Deleted.

                   1.5 Quiet Enjoyment; Access. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, Tenant shall quietly have, hold and
              enjoy the Tenant Space without hindrance from Landlord or any person or entity claiming by, through or under Landlord.
              Subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease (including, without limitation, the Datacenter Rules and Regulations (defined
              in Section 6.2, below)) and Landlord’s Access Control Systems (defined in Section 7.1, below) and Force Majeure (as defined
              in Section 17.14 below), Tenant shall have access to the Tenant Space twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week.

              2. TERM.
                  2.1 Term. The term of this Lease, and Tenant’s obligation to pay Rent under this Lease, shall commence on the
              Commencement Date and shall continue in effect for the period specified in Item 5 of the Basic Lease Information (the
              “Term”), unless this Lease is earlier terminated as provided herein.

                   2.2 Delivery of Tenant Space. Delivery of Tenant Space. Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
              the Commencement Date Conditions to occur prior to the Target

                                                                             -1-





              Commencement Date. Upon the occurrence of the Commencement Date, Landlord shall deliver the Commencement Date
              Notice to Tenant.

                        2.2.1 Intentionally deleted.

                         2.2.2 In the event that the Commencement Date Conditions have not occurred by the Target Commencement Date,
              Landlord shall not be deemed in default hereunder, and the Commencement Date shall be postponed, as Tenant’s sole and
              exclusive remedy, until the date on which the Commencement Date Conditions have occurred. Notwithstanding the forgoing, in
              the event that the Commencement Date Conditions have not occurred prior to December 31, 2007, subject to extension related
              to Tenant Delay (defined below) and Force Majeure (not to exceed 60 days of Force Majeure), Tenant shall have the right, as its
              sole and exclusive remedy, to terminate this Lease by delivering written notice of such termination to Landlord. Should the
              Commencement Date Conditions occur prior to Tenant’s exercise of the foregoing termination right, however, such termination
              right shall, in such event, expire and be of no further force or effect upon such occurrence of the Commencement Date
              Conditions. For the purposes of this Lease, “Tenant Delay” shall mean a delay in Landlord’s completion of the
              Commencement Date Conditions, which is attributable to or caused by any change order by Tenant.

                         2.2.3 Tenant acknowledges that Tenant shall be responsible for installing, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, any and
              all work (other than the completion of the Commencement Date Conditions) for the Premises (collectively, the “Tenant
              Work”). Sections 2.2, 2.2.1 & 2.2.2, above, notwithstanding, Landlord agrees, subject to the terms and conditions of this
              Section 2.2.3, to permit Tenant and its contractors, subcontractors, space planner/interior architect, engineers, consultants,
              vendors, suppliers and other representatives, and their respective employees to enter and occupy the Premises, prior to the
              Commencement Date (“Early Access”), for the purposes of inspecting same and for performing Tenant Work, including the
              installation of fixtures and equipment (e.g., telephone, communications and computer equipment and the wiring and cabling for
              same), on and after the date upon which Landlord notifies Tenant, verbally or otherwise, that the Premises is dust-free and safe
              for Tenant’s occupancy, as determined by Landlord in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion, but not before Tenant’s Early
              Access would materially delay Landlord’s ability to complete the Commencement Date Conditions on or before the Target
              Commencement Date (the date upon which Landlord provides such notice of Early Access is referred to herein as the “Early
              Access Date”; the period between the Early Access Date and the Commencement Date is referred to herein as the “Early
              Access Period”). Any such permission shall constitute a license only, conditioned upon Tenant’s:
                              (a) working in harmony with Landlord and Landlord’s agents, contractors, workmen, mechanics and suppliers;
              and

                               (b) furnishing Landlord with such insurance as Landlord may reasonably require against liabilities which may
              arise out of such entry; provided that, in no event shall such insurance requirements exceed those that are described on Exhibit
              “B”, attached hereto.

                        Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, the Early Access Period may be reduced by Landlord to the
              extent such Early Access materially interferes with Landlord’s ability to complete the Commencement Date Conditions on or
              before the Target Commencement Date. Additionally, Tenant agrees that, while Tenant shall not be required to pay Base Rent
              during the Early Access Period, Tenant shall be required to pay any and all electricity charges that accrue to the Premises
              during the Early Access Period. Tenant’s Early Access right is subject to Tenant executing and delivering to Landlord a
              Memorandum of Understanding in the form attached hereto as Exhibit “E-2”.

                    2.3 Extension Option.
                        2.3.1 Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 2.3, Tenant shall have the number of
              options (each, an “Extension Option”) specified in Item 6 of the Basic Lease Information to extend the Term of this Lease
              with respect to the entire Tenant Space, each for an

                                                                            -2-





              additional term of forty-eight (48) calendar months (collectively the “Extension Terms”, each an “Extension Term”), upon
              the same terms, conditions and provisions applicable to the then current Term of this Lease (except as provided otherwise
              herein). The Base Rent payable with respect to the Tenant Space for each year of the Extension Term (the “Option Rent”) shall
              be increased hereunder as of the first (1st) day of each such year to be equal to one hundred three percent (103%) of the Base
              Rent payable for the immediately preceding year of the Term of the Lease, as extended.

                         2.3.2 Tenant may exercise each Extension Option only by delivering to Landlord a written notice (an “Option
              Exercise Notice”) at least nine (9) calendar months (and not more than twelve (12) calendar months) prior to then applicable
              expiration date of the Term, which Option Exercise Notice shall specify that Tenant is irrevocably exercising its Extension
              Option so as to extend the Term of this Lease by an Extension Term on the terms set forth in this Section 2.3. In the event that
              Tenant shall duly exercise an Extension Option, the Term shall be extended to include the applicable Extension Term (and all
              references to the Term in this Lease shall be deemed to refer to the Term specified in Item 5 of the Basic Lease Information,
              plus all duly exercised Extension Terms). In the event that Tenant shall fail to deliver an Option Exercise Notice within the
              applicable time period specified herein for the delivery thereof, time being of the essence, at the election of Landlord, Tenant
              shall be deemed to have forever waived and relinquished such Extension Option, and any other options or rights to renew or
              extend the Term effective after the then applicable expiration date of the Term shall terminate and shall be of no further force or
              effect.

                          2.3.3 Tenant shall have the right to exercise any Extension Option only with respect to the entire Tenant Space leased
              by Tenant at the time that Tenant delivers an Option Exercise Notice. If Tenant duly exercises an Extension Option, Landlord
              and Tenant shall execute an amendment reflecting such exercise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
              attempted exercise by Tenant of an Extension Option shall, at the election of Landlord, be invalid, ineffective, and of no force
              or effect if, on the date on which Tenant delivers an Option Exercise Notice or on the date on which the Option Term is
              scheduled to commence there shall be an uncured Event of Default by Tenant under this Lease
