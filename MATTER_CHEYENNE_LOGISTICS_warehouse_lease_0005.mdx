                    9.        ESTIMATED EXPENSES.

                               9.1       Payment. "Estimated Expenses" for any particular year shall mean Landlord's
                                         estimate of Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes for a calendar year. For
                                         the purposes of Section 9 of this Lease, Tenant’s Proportionate Share and
                                         Tenant’s Project Share shall collectively be referred to as “Tenant’s Share.”
                                         Tenant shall pay Tenant's Share of the Estimated Expenses with installments of
                                         Base Rent in monthly installments of one-twelfth (1/12th) thereof on the first
                                         day of each calendar month during such year. If at any time Landlord determines
                                         that Operating Expenses and/or Real Property Taxes are projected to vary from
                                         the then Estimated

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                                8





                                         Expenses, Landlord may, by notice to Tenant, revise such Estimated Expenses,
                                         and Tenant's monthly installments for the remainder of such year shall be
                                         adjusted so that by the end of such calendar year Tenant has paid to Landlord
                                         Tenant's Share of the revised Estimated Expenses for such year. If Landlord does
                                         not provide Tenant with an estimate of the Operating Expenses or the Real
                                         Property Taxes by January 1 of a calendar year, Tenant shall continue to pay
                                         monthly installments based on the previous year’s estimate(s) until Landlord
                                         provides Tenant with the new estimate. Upon delivery of the new estimate, an
                                         adjustment shall be made for any month for which Tenant paid monthly
                                         installments based on the previous year’s estimate. Tenant’s Share of Estimated
                                         Expenses for the 2021 calendar year is estimated to be Twelve Thousand Two
                                         Hundred Twelve and 80/100 Dollars ($12,212.80) per month (which is Ten
                                         Cents ($0.10 per month per square foot in the Premises).

                               9.2       Adjustment. "Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes Adjustment"
                                         (or "Adjustment") shall mean the difference between Tenant's Share of
                                         Estimated Expenses, on the one hand, and the actual Tenant's Share of Operating
                                         Expenses and Real Property Taxes, collectively, on the other hand, for any
                                         calendar year. Promptly after the end of each calendar year, Landlord shall
                                         deliver to Tenant a statement of actual Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses and
                                         Real Property Taxes for such calendar year, accompanied by a computation of
                                         the Adjustment. Subject to review and adjustment in accordance with Section
                                         9.3, for payment of the differential between the estimated and the actual
                                         Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes, if Tenant's payments for estimated
                                         Operating Expenses are less than Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses, or if
                                         Tenant’s estimated payments of Real Property Taxes are less than Tenant’s Share
                                         of Real Property Taxes, then Tenant shall pay the difference within twenty (20)
                                         days after receipt of such statement. Tenant's obligation to pay such amount shall
                                         survive the expiration or termination of this Lease. If Tenant's payments for
                                         estimated Operating Expenses exceed the actual Tenant's Share of Operating
                                         Expenses, or if Tenant’s payments for estimated Real Property Taxes exceed the
                                         actual Tenant’s Share of Real Property Taxes, then (i) so long as an Event of
                                         Default by Tenant has not occurred and is continuing, Landlord shall credit such
                                         excess amount to future installments of Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses
                                         and/or Real Property Taxes, as the case may be, for the next calendar year (or
                                         pay to Tenant such excess in the event the Term has expired and (ii) if an Event
                                         of Default by Tenant has occurred and is continuing, Landlord shall apply such
                                         excess amount to any Base Rent then due and outstanding.

                               9.3       Within sixty (60) days after receiving Landlord's actual Tenant's Share of
                                         Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes, Tenant (or its agent) may, upon
                                         advance written notice to Landlord and during reasonable business hours, cause
                                         a review of Landlord's books and records with respect to the preceding calendar
                                         year to determine the accuracy of the Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses and
                                         Real Property Taxes. Landlord shall make all pertinent records available for
                                                              Document




                                         review that are reasonably necessary for Tenant (or its agent) to conduct its
                                         review either in person or electronically. If Tenant retains an agent, at Tenant's
                                         sole cost and expense, to review Landlord's records, the agent shall be a CPA of
                                         national standing, which may include Tenant’s employees, that is not
                                         compensated on a contingency basis and is also subject to a reasonable
                                         confidentiality agreement. Within forty-five (45) days after all of the records
                                         necessary for review are made available to Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to
                                         give Landlord written notice (an "Objection Notice") stating in reasonable
                                         detail any objection to the Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses and Real
                                         Property Taxes for that year. If Tenant provides Landlord with a timely
                                         Objection Notice, Landlord and Tenant shall work together in good faith to
                                         resolve any issues raised in Tenant's Objection Notice. If Tenant fails to provide
                                         Landlord with a timely Objection Notice, Landlord's Tenant's Share of Operating
                                         Expenses and Real Property Taxes shall be deemed final and binding, and Tenant
                                         shall have no further right to review or object to such statement for that year. If
                                         Landlord and Tenant determine that the actual Operating Expenses and/or Real
                                         Property Taxes for the calendar year are less than those reported, Landlord shall
                                         provide Tenant with a credit against the next installment of Rent in the

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                                9





                                         amount of the overpayment by Tenant. Likewise, if Landlord and Tenant
                                         determine that the actual Operating Expenses and/or Real Property Taxes for the
                                         calendar year are greater than reported, Tenant shall pay Landlord the amount of
                                         any underpayment within thirty (30) days after such determination. The records
                                         obtained by Tenant shall be treated as confidential.
