Tenant shall present to Landlord plans and specifications for such additional work at the time approval is sought.  In the event Landlord consents to the making of any alterations, additions, or improvements to the Premises by Tenant, the same shall be made by Tenant at Tenant’s sole cost and expense.  All such work with respect to any alterations, additions and improvements shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and diligently prosecuted to completion such that, except as absolutely necessary during the course of such work, the Premises shall at all times be a complete operating unit.  Any such alterations, additions, or improvements shall be performed and done strictly in accordance with all laws and ordinances relating thereto.  In performing the work or any such alterations, additions or improvements, Tenant shall have the same performed in such a manner as not to obstruct access to any portion of the Building.  Any alterations, additions, or improvements to the Premises, made pursuant to this Article or pursuant to Section 7.03 including, but not limited to, wall and floor coverings; paneling; HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems; cabinet portions of any exterior signs and built-in cabinet work, (excluding movable furniture, equipment, sign fascia or individual sign lettering and trade fixtures all of which can be removed), shall at once become a part of the realty and shall be surrendered with the Premises unless Landlord otherwise elects at the time of approval.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, for tax purposes, Tenant shall be deemed to be the owner (without removal rights) of such permanent alterations, additions, or improvements until the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

12.02           Legal Requirements; Indemnity:     All alterations and additions undertaken by Landlord or Tenant shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable laws, ordinances and building codes.  Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other from any and all claims, liabilities, losses and damages growing out of any alterations or construction undertaken by such party, including all costs, expenses and attorney’s fees resulting from claims made by other tenants in the Building, their agents, employees and invitees.

Unless resulting from Landlord’s negligence or willful misconduct and except as provided below, Landlord shall not be liable in the event of any interruption in the supply of any utility services to the Premises or Building.  Landlord will provide Tenant with at least three (3) days advance notice delivered to the Premises if Landlord intends to interrupt or cause to be interrupted any of the foregoing utilities or services at the Premises.  If utility services or other services to the Premises are to be interrupted for a period of time longer than twenty-four (24) hours by virtue of an act of negligence by Landlord, Minimum Base Rent will be abated during the period of interruption until such services are restored.  Tenant agrees that it will not install any equipment which will exceed or overload the capacity of any utility facilities and that if any equipment installed by Tenant shall require additional utility facilities, the same shall be installed at Tenant’s expense in accordance with plans and specifications to be approved in writing by Landlord.  Tenant shall be solely responsible for and shall promptly pay all charges for use or consumption for heat, sewer, water, gas, electricity, garbage removal, or any other utility services serving the Premises.

1. `COMMON AREAS`

Landlord hereby grants to Tenant and its employees, agents, contractors, customers, assignees, subtenants and licensees a non-exclusive right to use the Common Areas, subject to such reasonable nondiscriminatory rules and regulations governing use as Landlord may from time to time prescribe.  All Common Areas shall be subject to the exclusive control and management of Landlord.  Landlord shall have the right to construct, maintain and operate lighting and other facilities on all said areas and improvements; to police the same; to change the area, level, location and arrangement of parking areas and other facilities to such extent as may be legally sufficient to prevent a dedication thereof or the accrual of any right to any person or the public therein; and to close temporarily all or any portion of the Common Areas of facilities to discourage non-customer parking.  Landlord shall operate and maintain the Common Areas in such manner as Landlord in its discretion shall determine, shall have full right and authority to employ and discharge all personnel with respect thereto, and shall have the right, through reasonable rules, regulations, and/or restrictive covenants promulgated by it from time to time, to control the use and operation of the Common Areas in order that the same may occur in a proper and orderly fashion.
