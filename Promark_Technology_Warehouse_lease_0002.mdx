3. **TERM.** Landlord shall deliver possession of the Premises in the condition required under Section 1 to the Tenant, which shall occur after this lease has been fully executed by both parties, and the lease has been delivered to both parties. The term of this Lease shall be ten (10) years and four (4) months, commencing on the date that Landlord delivers the space per this Section 3.

4. **RENT.** Tenant shall pay the following Base Rent and Additional Rent (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Rent”) during the term of this Lease, in advance, on the first day of each calendar month, or as otherwise set forth in this Lease, without setoff or deduction, at the office of Landlord. Payment of the first month’s rent due hereunder shall be paid at the time of the execution of this Lease by Tenant. In the event any Rent is due for a partial calendar month or year, the Rent shall be equitably adjusted to reflect that portion of the lease term within such month or year. All accrued Rent shall survive the Lease term.

(a) **Base.** Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Base Rent in the first lease year (each such lease year, a “Lease Year”) which shall be, the sum of Seventy-Three Thousand Fifty-Nine and 31/100 Dollars ($73,059.31), per year, payable in equal monthly installments of Six Thousand Eighty-Eight and 28/100 Dollars ($6,088.28) each. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be required to pay Base Rent for the first four (4) months of the Lease term. The aforegoing Base Rent for the first Lease Year is calculated based upon the total aggregate cost of Landlord’s Tenant Improvements being One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) (the “Landlord’s Tenant Improvements Cost Base Amount”). Said Tenant Improvements Costs Base Amount shall be fully amortized over the 10 years Lease term at an interest rate of eight percent (8%) per annum and is included in the aforementioned Base Rent amount. Each Lease Year shall be comprised of complete twelve (12) month periods. The first and the last Lease Year will include any portion of the first and last calendar month of term, as the case may be, if the commencement of the term shall be on other than the first day of a calendar year. This Base Rent shall increase by two and one-half percent (2.5%) compounded on each anniversary date of the commencement of the Lease.

(b) **Additional.** Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, Tenant’s pro rata share of the CAM expenses (as such term is hereinafter defined) incurred by Landlord for and on behalf of the Total Property; and, in addition thereto, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, Tenant’s pro rata share of any Taxes and Insurance (as such terms are hereinafter defined) payable by Landlord in the then Total Property’s fiscal year. These charges shall be estimated by Landlord, paid monthly by Tenant, and reconciled in March of each succeeding year.

(i) **Taxes**. Taxes shall include, without limitation, any tax, assessment, or governmental charge (herein collectively referred to as “Taxes”) imposed against the Total Property, or against any of Landlord’s personal property located therein. Taxes, as herein defined, are predicated upon the present system of taxation in the state of [Maryland](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.lawinsider.com/contracts/tagged/maryland-us). Therefore, if due to a future change in the method of taxation any rent, franchise, use, profit or other tax shall be levied against Landlord in lieu of any Tax which would otherwise constitute a “real estate tax”, such rent, franchise, use, profit or other tax shall be deemed to be a Tax for the purposes herein. In the event Landlord is assessed with a Tax which Landlord, in its sole discretion, deems excessive, Landlord may challenge said Tax or may defer compliance therewith to the extent legally permitted; and, in such an event, Tenant shall be liable for Tenant’s pro rata share of all reasonable costs in connection with such challenge.

(ii) Insurance. Insurance shall include, without limitation, premiums for liability, property damage, fire, workers compensation, rent and any and all other insurance (herein collectively referred to as “Insurance”) which Landlord deems necessary to carry on, for, or in connection with Landlord’s operation of the Total Property, including Insurance to be carried by Landlord pursuant to the provisions of Section 19 hereof. In addition thereto, in the event Tenant’s use of the Premises shall result in an increase of any of Landlord’s Insurance premiums, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, upon demand, as Additional Rent, an amount equal to such increase in Insurance. Such payments of Insurance premiums shall be in addition to all premiums of insurance which Tenant is required to carry pursuant to Section 19 of this Lease.

(iii) Common Area Maintenance. Common area maintenance charges (hereinafter referred to as “CAM” expenses) shall include by way of example but not as a limitation, without limitation: the maintenance, repair and replacement, if necessary, of the downspouts, gutters, access roads, driveways, sidewalks and passageways; trunk-line plumbing (as opposed to branch-line plumbing); common utilities and exterior lighting; landscaping; snow removal; fire protection; exterior painting; interior painting of the common areas of the Total Property; management fees; asset management fees; and all other expenses incurred by Landlord for or on behalf of the Total Property. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, in no event shall CAM expenses include any expense chargeable to a capital account or capital improvement under generally accepted accounting principles as currently employed by Landlord, except for capital expenditures necessary to comply with government regulations or law or capital expenditures which will reasonably reduce operating costs, and except that CAM expenses may include the amortization or depreciation of capital improvements (other than the existing building improvements) or equipment utilized in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Total Property over the useful lives of such capital improvements and equipment; nor shall CAM expenses include any cost associated with leasing, including but not limited to brokerage fees, advertising and tenant improvements.

In addition to the aforesaid, Landlord reserves the right to perform any or all of the repairs and maintenance covenanted to be performed by Tenant pursuant to Section 8, below; and, in such event, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, Landlord’s reasonable costs of such repairs and maintenance.

(iv) **Payment of Additional Rent.** Landlord shall invoice Tenant monthly or otherwise from time to time, for Tenant’s pro rata share of the Taxes, Insurance and CAM expenses, as reasonably estimated by Landlord; and Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, those amounts for which Tenant is invoiced within thirty (30) days after receipt of said invoice. Any monies paid in advance to Landlord by Tenant shall not accrue interest thereon. At the end of each calendar year or property fiscal year, Landlord shall deliver a statement to Tenant setting forth the difference between Tenant’s actual pro rata share of Taxes, Insurance and/or CAM expenses and the total amount of monthly payments paid by Tenant to Landlord. Tenant shall thereafter pay to Landlord the full amount of any difference between Tenant’s actual obligation over the total amount of Tenant’s estimated payments within thirty (30) days after receipt of said statement; conversely, in the event Tenant’s estimated payments exceed Tenant’s actual obligation, Landlord shall refund the overpayment to Tenant or credit the amount to the next installments of CAM due. For purposes of this Lease, Tenant’s pro rata share is hereinafter defined as a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the square footage of the Premises, and the denominator of which shall be the square footage of the Total Property, which pro rata share is hereby agreed to be equal to fifty percent (50%). In the event this Lease expires on a date other than the end of a billing period, Tenant’s obligation with respect to any amounts owed to Landlord shall survive the expiration of the lease term, and shall be invoiced to Tenant when the same have been accurately determined or, at Landlord’s option, such amounts shall be reasonably estimated by Landlord to reflect the period of time the Lease was in effect during such billing period.

Landlord shall maintain complete and accurate records of all Taxes, Insurance and CAM expenses incurred in connection with the Total Property. Tenant shall have the right to inspect such records at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, at the office of Landlord’s managing agent during said agent’s normal business hours, upon ten (10) days prior written notice once a calendar year.
