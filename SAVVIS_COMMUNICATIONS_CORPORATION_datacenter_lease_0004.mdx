              suitability or fitness for the conduct of Tenant’s Permitted Use, its business or for any other purpose and (ii) except
              as specifically set forth herein, Landlord shall have no obligation to construct or install any improvements in or to

              persons entitled to use the same, and subject to such reasonable rules and regulations governing use as Landlord
              may from time to time prescribe. Tenant shall not solicit business or display merchandise within the Common Area,
              or distribute handbills therein, or take any action which would interfere with the rights of other persons to use the
              Common Area. Landlord may temporarily close any part of the Common Area for such periods of time as may be
              necessary to prevent the public from obtaining prescriptive rights or to make repairs or alterations.
