1. `NET LEASE: OPERATING EXPENSES`

5.01           Additional Occupancy Costs:     It is the intent of both parties that except as otherwise provided in this Lease, the Minimum Base Rent shall be absolutely net to Landlord throughout the Term and, that all costs, expenses and obligations of every kind relating to the Premises which may arise or become due during the Term  shall be paid by Tenant, but excluding any costs, expenses, and obligations which are Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, or which arise from Landlord’s negligence, intentional acts of omissions by Landlord, its agents, employees or contractors, or Landlord’s breach of its obligations under this Lease.  Commencing on the Commencement Date and continuing monthly thereafter during the remainder of the Term, Tenant shall pay as additional rent, without demand thereof and without offset or deduction, (together with each payment of Minimum Base Rent) an amount equal to Tenant’s Proportionate Share, (defined below) of expenses and charges as set forth in Section 5.02 through Section 5.04 (“Operating Expenses”).  Tenant’s  “Proportionate Share” of the Operating Expenses shall be determined by multiplying the Operating Expense in question by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total square footage of the Premises, and the denominator of which shall be the total square footage  of the Building.

5.02           Taxes:

```
          (a)   Commencing on the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay monthly its Proportionate Share of all Real Estate Taxes (defined later) levied or assessed by lawful taxing authorities against the Land

```

serving the Building (the “Land”), the Building and all improvements attached to the Land.  The amount

23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

of Real Estate Taxes upon which such payment is based shall be estimated from the most current notice(s) of assessment or tax xxxx(s) concerning the entire Building or, if there are none, such amount as Landlord may reasonably determine.  A tax xxxx submitted by Landlord to Tenant shall be conclusive evidence of the amount of taxes assessed or levied, as well as the items taxed.  Landlord represents that the Land is or will be a separate parcel for ad valorem tax purposes.

(b)   As used herein “Real Estate Taxes”: shall mean all real estate or rental taxes, assessments, levies, charges, surcharges, water and sewer fees (not based on consumption), standby fees, the cost of protesting any of the foregoing and any other governmental charges or impositions, whether general or special, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, which may be levied on, assessed against, or charged with respect to the ownership of, or other equivalent interest in: (i) the Land serving the Building; (ii) the Building and other improvements situated on the Land serving the Building; and (iii) any other levies in lieu of the foregoing or any assessments thereof for public improvements which are deemed to benefit such Land serving the Building.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Real Estate Taxes” shall not include any income tax, capital levy, estate, succession, inheritance or transfer taxes or similar tax of Landlord.

(c)   Landlord or Landlord’s agent will contest what Landlord deems to be unreasonable tax, assessments, impositions and charges of every kind and nature by any governmental authority on the Building or the Land or otherwise provide Tenant the right of contest in the name of Landlord as provided below.  If, as a result of any contest, application or proceeding brought by or on behalf of Landlord for reduction in any taxes or the assessed valuation of the Premises affecting any tax year occurring during the Term, there shall be a decrease in Real Estate Taxes for any such year, Landlord’s next statement following such decrease shall include an adjustment for such tax year reflecting that tax decrease less any of Landlord’s third party expenses; if the reduction occurs after the expiration or termination of this Lease, the amount of the adjustment shall be promptly paid to Tenant.

(d)           If Landlord does not elect to contest what Tenant deems to be an unreasonable tax assessment, imposition or charge, Tenant may contest the same, in the name of Landlord; provided, however, that Landlord agrees to reasonably cooperate with Tenant in contesting such items or amounts.  Landlord shall promptly provide Tenant with the proposed notice of property valuation and tax changes so that Tenant will be able to contest the Real Estate Taxes in a timely manner.  If there shall be a decrease in property taxes, assessments, impositions or charges for any such tax year resulting from Tenant’s contest, notwithstanding the fact that the Lease Term may have expired, Tenant shall be entitled to (A) reimbursement, up to the amount of the decrease, for all reasonable costs paid by Tenant in connection with the contest, application or proceeding, and (B) to a cash payment from Landlord, or credit toward amounts owed by Tenant under this Lease, equal to Tenant’s Proportionate Share of such refund or award.  Tenant shall receive a copy of any xxxx for tax payments upon Tenant’s written request.

(e)           Tenant shall also be solely responsible for and shall pay before delinquency all municipal, county, state or federal taxes assessed during the Term, against or for leasehold improvements; lighting fixtures; equipment; interior partitions; heating and cooling; or ventilating equipment located within the Premises; or any other interior improvement of whatever kind and to whomever belonging, situated, or installed in or upon the Premises, whether or not affixed to the realty.  In the event that the taxing authorities shall at any time during the term of this Lease assess any of the above-described property against the real estate, the Tenant shall repay the taxes thus assessed to Landlord and paid by Landlord no later than ten (10) business days after receipt of notice of payment by Landlord.
