18.1.The Landlord confirms and warrants that the concession deed it entered into with the Harbour of Liege on 12 June 2019 does not contain any specific obligations in connection with the intended use of the Leased Premises or any other mandatory provisions that are to be complied with by the Tenant other than as provided for in this Agreement.

**Article 19** - **Bankruptcy- Default**

19.2.In the event that the Agreement is terminated for cause by the Landlord, the Tenant shall bear all costs, charges and expenses arising therefrom and, in addition thereto shall pay the compensation due under this Agreement until the end of its contractual term or, where relevant, the date of early termination notified by the Tenant in accordance with the provisions of article 6 above, increased by the charges, taxes, and contributions for the same period, without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement (the "**Tenant Damages for Wrongful Termination**"). In the event, however, that the Tenant secures a third party-replacement tenant, reasonably acceptable to the Landlord and of Tenant's repute and financial standing (assessed on the date of the date of this Agreement), that effectively leases the Premises starting no later than on the 12 month-anniversary of the date of termination for cause by the Landlord and on terms at least equivalent to the Tenants' lease terms applicable as per that date, the Tenant Damages for Wrongful Termination shall be in an amount equal to 12 months of Rental Fee, plus its share in the costs, taxes, taxes and contributions for the same period. Should the Landlord effectively secure a lease within 6 months as from the date of termination for cause by the Landlord on terms at least equivalent to the Tenant's lease terms applicable as per that date, the Tenant Damages for Wrongful Termination shall be in an amount equal to 12 months of Rental Fee, plus its share in the costs, taxes, taxes and contributions for the same period. None of the foregoing shall preclude the Landlord from claiming additional indemnification if it evidences that it has incurred a larger damage, in ****order for its entire damage to be covered appropriately.
