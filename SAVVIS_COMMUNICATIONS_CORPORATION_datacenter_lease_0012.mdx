              13. SURRENDER OF TENANT SPACE; HOLDING OVER.
                    13.1 Tenant’s Method of Surrender. Upon the expiration of the Term of this Lease, or upon any earlier
              termination of this Lease or the termination of Tenant’s right to possess the Tenant Space, Tenant shall, subject to the
              provisions of Section 8.4 and this Article 13, quit and surrender possession of the Tenant Space to Landlord in good
              order and clean condition, reasonable wear and tear and damage by Casualty or Taking excepted. If Tenant fails to
              surrender the Tenant Space upon the expiration or any earlier termination of this Lease or the termination of Tenant’s
              right to possess the Tenant Space in accordance with the terms of this Lease, then (subject to Section 13.3) Tenant
              shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold the Landlord Group harmless from, and shall reimburse Landlord for its
              first-party losses, costs and expenses in connection with, all Claims (including, without limitation, costs and
              expenses incurred by Landlord in returning the Tenant Space to the condition in which Tenant was to surrender and
              Claims made by any succeeding tenant founded on or resulting from Tenant’s failure to surrender the Tenant Space)
              arising out of or in any manner relating to such failure to quit and surrender possession of the Tenant Space to
              Landlord in the condition required hereunder upon such date.

                   13.2 Disposal of Tenant’s Personal Property. Subject to the terms of the CAA, if any property not belonging
              to Landlord remains in the Tenant Space after the expiration of or any earlier termination of the Term of this Lease
              or the termination of Tenant’s right to possess the Tenant Space, and Tenant fails to remove such property within
              fifteen (15) business days after written notice to Tenant, Tenant shall be deemed to have authorized Landlord to
              make such disposition of such property as Landlord may desire without liability for compensation or damages to
              Tenant in the event that such property is the property of Tenant; and in the event that such property is the property of
              someone other than Tenant, Tenant shall indemnify and hold the Landlord Group harmless from all Claims arising
              out of, in connection with, or in any manner related to any removal, exercise or dominion over and/or disposition of
              such property by Landlord.

                                                                           -21-





                                                                                                                                 Page

                    13.3 Holding Over. If Tenant should remain in possession of all or any portion of the Tenant Space after the
              expiration of the Term of this Lease (or any earlier termination of this Lease or the termination of Tenant’s right to
              possess the Tenant Space), without the execution by Landlord and Tenant of a new lease or an extension of the Term
              of this Lease, then Tenant shall be deemed to be occupying the entire Tenant Space as a tenant-at-sufferance, upon
              all of the terms contained herein, except as to term and Base Rent and any other provision reasonably determined by
              Landlord to be inapplicable. During any such holdover period, Tenant shall pay to Landlord (a) monthly Base Rent
              in an amount equal to (i) one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) with respect to the first thirty (30) days of such
              holdover, (ii) one hundred fifty percent (150%) with respect to the next sixty (60) days of such holdover, and
              (iii) two hundred percent (200%) thereafter, of the Base Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord during the last month of
              the Term of this Lease, plus (b) one hundred percent (100%) of the additional rent payable by Tenant to Landlord
              during the last month of the Term of this Lease. The monthly rent payable for such holdover period shall in no event
              be construed as a penalty or as liquidated damages for such retention of possession. Neither any provision hereof nor
              any acceptance by Landlord of any rent after any such expiration or earlier termination shall be deemed a consent to
              any holdover hereunder or result in a renewal of this Lease or an extension of the Term, or any waiver of any of
              Landlord’s rights or remedies with respect to such holdover. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
              contained herein, (a) Landlord expressly reserves the right to require Tenant to surrender possession of the Tenant
              Space upon the expiration of the Term of this Lease or upon the earlier termination hereof or at any time during any
              holdover and the right to assert any remedy at law or in equity to evict Tenant and collect damages in connection
              with any such holdover, and (b) Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold the Landlord Group harmless from and
              against any and all Claims (including, without limitation, all lost profits and other consequential damages, attorneys’
              fees, consultants’ fees and court costs incurred or suffered by or asserted against Landlord) arising out of or in any
              manner related to Tenant’s failure to surrender the Tenant Space upon the expiration or earlier termination of this
              Lease or upon termination of Tenant’s right to possess the Tenant Space in accordance with the provisions of this
              Lease.

                   13.4 Survival. The provisions of this Article 13 shall survive the expiration or early termination of this Lease.

              14. WAIVER OF CLAIMS; INDEMNITY.
                   14.1 Waiver. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Tenant, as a material part of the consideration to Landlord,
              hereby assumes all risk of, and waives all claims it may have against the Landlord Group (as defined in the Basic
              Lease Information) for damage to or loss of property (including, without limitation, loss of profits and intangible
              property) or personal injury or loss of life or other damages of any kind resulting from the Property, the Building, or
              the Tenant Space or any part thereof becoming out of repair, by reason of any repair or alteration thereof, or
              resulting from any accident within the Property, the Building, or the Tenant Space or on or about any space
              adjoining the same, or resulting directly or indirectly from any act or omission of any person, or due to any
              condition, design or defect of the Property, the Building, the Tenant Space, or any space adjoining the same, or the
              mechanical systems of the Building, which may exist or occur, whether such damage, loss or injury results from
              conditions arising upon the Tenant Space, or upon other portions of the Building, or from other sources or places,
              and regardless of whether the cause of such damage, loss or injury or the means of repairing the same is accessible
              to Tenant; provided, however, that such assumption and waiver shall not apply to the extent such claims are
              determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been proximately caused by the negligence or willful
              misconduct of Landlord. Tenant agrees that Landlord will not have any responsibility or liability for any damage to
              Tenant’s equipment or interruption of Tenant’s operations which is caused by any other tenant or occupant of the
              Building or the Property or the employees, agents, contractors, technicians, representatives, customers, co-locators
              or invitees of any such tenant or occupant. In that connection, Tenant agrees that in no event shall Landlord be
              deemed to have been negligent or engaged in intentional misconduct merely because Landlord failed to enforce the
              terms of any other agreement with any other party or tenant in the Building, or failed to cause any such party or
              tenant to maintain its premises or cure any damages caused by such party or tenant or meet any obligations that such
              party or tenant had failed to satisfy.

                         14.2.1 Tenant’s Indemnification. Subject to Sections 9.3 and 14.2.2 hereof, and except to the extent
              caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,
              Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord and the Landlord Group (as such term is
              defined in the Basic Lease Information) from and against (and to reimburse Landlord and the Landlord Group) for
              any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, damages (including, without limitation, any form of
              consequential damages), obligations, liabilities, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
              attorneys’ fees, legal costs, and other costs and expenses of defending against any claims, actions, suits, or
              proceedings) (collectively, “Claims”) arising from, in connection with, or in any manner relating to (or alleged to
              arise from, to be in connection with, or to be in any manner related to): (i) the use or occupancy of the Tenant Space
              or any portion of the Building or the Property by Tenant or any person claiming by, through or under Tenant, its
              partners, and their respective officers, agents, servants or employees of Tenant or any such person (collectively,
              “Tenant Parties”), (ii) the acts or omissions of Tenant or any Tenant Party, (iii) any default of this Lease by Tenant;
              or (iv) from, by or with regard to any Colocating Party, regardless Landlord’s negligence. In the event that any
              action or proceeding is brought against Landlord or any member of the Landlord Group by reason of any such
              Claim, Tenant upon notice from Landlord shall defend such action or proceeding at Tenant’s cost and expense by
              counsel approved by Landlord. Tenant’s obligations under this Section 14.2.1 shall survive the expiration or
              termination of this Lease as to any matters arising prior to such expiration or termination or prior to Tenant’s
              vacation of the Tenant Space and the Building. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
              Section 14.2, (aa) nothing contained in this Section 14.2.1 shall be interpreted or used to in any way affect, limit,
              reduce or abrogate any insurance coverage provided by any insurer to either Tenant or Landlord; and (bb) insurable
              risks and events that are otherwise covered by Section 9.2 or 9.3 of this Lease, and interruptions of services that are
              otherwise governed by Section 7.6 of this Leases shall be governed by said Sections 9.2, 9.3 and 7.6, respectively,
              and are, collectively, excluded from the terms of this Section 14.2.1. This indemnity provision shall survive the
              termination or expiration of this Lease.

                        14.2.2 Landlord’s Indemnification. Subject to Sections 14.2.1 and 9.2, and except to the extent caused by
              the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Landlord shall
              defend, indemnify, and hold harmless (and to reimburse Tenant and the Tenant Parties) Tenant and the Tenant Parties
              from and against all Claims arising from, in connection with, or in any manner relating to (or alleged to arise from,

              agents, servants, employees or contractors, or any member of the Landlord Group or (ii) any default of this Lease by
              Landlord. The foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that in no event shall
              Landlord’s indemnification obligations arise merely because Landlord failed to enforce the terms of any other
              agreement with any other party or tenant in the Building, or failed to cause any such party or tenant to maintain its
              premises or cure any damages caused by such party or tenant or meet any obligations that such party or tenant had
              failed to satisfy. In the event that any action or proceeding is brought against Tenant or any member of the Tenant
              Parties by reason of any such Claim, Landlord upon notice from Tenant shall defend such action or proceeding at
              Landlord’s cost and expense by counsel reasonably approved by Tenant. Landlord’s obligations under this
              Section 14.2.2 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease as to any matters arising prior to such
              expiration or termination or prior to Tenant’s vacation of the Tenant Space and the Building. Notwithstanding any
              provision to the contrary contained in this Section 14.2.2, (aa) nothing contained in this Section 14.2.2 shall be
              interpreted or used to in any way affect, limit, reduce or abrogate any insurance coverage provided by any insurer to
              either Tenant or Landlord; and (bb) insurable risks and events that are otherwise covered by Section 9.2 or 9.3 of
              this Lease shall be governed by said Section 9.2 and 9.3, respectively, and are, collectively, excluded from the terms
              of this Section 14.2.2. This indemnity provision shall survive the termination or expiration of this Lease.

                                                                           -23-
                                                                Data Center Lease




                                                                                                                                 Page

                   14.3 Liens. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) in no event shall Tenant have any right (express
              or implied) to create or permit there to be established any mechanic’s or materialman’s lien of any nature against the
              Tenant Space, the Building or the Property or against Landlord’s or Tenant’s interest therein or hereunder, including,
              without limitation, for any improvement or improvements by Tenant, and Tenant shall fully pay the cost of any
              improvement or improvements made or contracted for by Tenant. Any mechanic’s lien filed against the Tenant
              Space, the Building or the Property, or any portion of any of the above, for work claimed to have been done, or
              materials claimed to have been furnished to Tenant, shall be duly discharged, bonded-off or insured over by Tenant
              (or on Tenant’s behalf) within twenty (20) days after the filing of the lien.

                   14.4 Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease (including any exhibits
              hereto) to the contrary, in no event shall either party hereto be liable for any consequential damages or any damages
              based upon “lost profit” or “loss of business” (collectively, “Consequential Damages”). The foregoing
              notwithstanding, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that, in no event, shall any portion of the holdover Rent
              described in Section 13.3 hereof be deemed to represent any type of Consequential Damages

                   14.5 Landlord’s Lien. Landlord hereby expressly waives and releases any and all contractual liens, rights of
              distraint and security interests or constitutional and/or statutory liens and security interests arising by operation of
              law to which Landlord might now or hereafter be entitled on the property of Tenant which Tenant now or hereafter
              places in or upon the Premises (except for judgment liens that may arise in favor of Landlord). The waiver and
              release contained herein shall not waive, release or otherwise affect any unsecured claim Landlord may have against
              Tenant.
