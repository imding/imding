13. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS OF PREMISES
                   (a) Maintenance by Tenant. Throughout the Term, Tenant shall, at its sole expense, (1) keep and maintain in
              good order and condition the Building, and repair and replace every part thereof, including glass, windows, window
              frames, window casements, skylights, interior and exterior doors, door frames and door closers; interior lighting
              (including, without limitation, light bulbs and ballasts), the portions of the plumbing and electrical systems located
              in or exclusively serving the Premises, all communications systems serving the Building, Tenant’s signage, interior
              demising walls and partitions, equipment, interior painting and interior walls and floors, and the roll-up doors, ramps
              and dock equipment, including, without limitation, dock bumpers, and dock lights located in or on the Building
              (excepting only those portions of the Building or the Project to be maintained by Landlord, as provided in
              Paragraph 13(b) below), (2) furnish all expendables, including light bulbs, paper goods and soaps, used in the
              Building, and (3) keep and maintain in good order and condition, repair and replace all of Tenant’s security systems
              in or about or serving the Building and, except to the extent that Landlord notifies Tenant in writing of its intention
              to arrange for such monitoring, cause the fire alarm systems serving the Building to be monitored by a monitoring or
              protective services firm approved by Landlord in writing. Tenant shall not do nor shall Tenant allow Tenant’s Agents
              to do anything to cause any damage, deterioration or unsightliness to the Premises, the Building or the Project.
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have no responsibility to repair any damage to the Premises caused
              solely by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its employees, agents or contractors, which is not
              covered by insurance that Tenant is required to carry under this Lease or otherwise has in effect.

                   (b) Maintenance by Landlord. Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 13(a), 21 and 22, and further subject to
              Tenant’s obligation under Paragraph 4 to reimburse Landlord, in the form of Additional Rent, for Tenant’s
              Proportionate Share(s) of the cost and expense of the following items, Landlord shall repair and maintain the
              following items: the roof coverings


              (provided that Tenant installs no additional air conditioning or other equipment on the roof that damages the roof
              coverings, in which event Tenant shall pay all costs resulting from the presence of such additional equipment); the
              Parking Area and pavement, landscaping, sprinkler systems, sidewalks, driveways, curbs, and lighting systems
              adjacent to the Building. Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 13(a), 21 and 22, Landlord, at its own cost and
              expense, agrees to repair and maintain the following items: the structural portions of the roof (specifically excluding
              the roof coverings), the foundation, the footings, the floor slab, and the load bearing walls and exterior walls of the
              Building (excluding any glass and any routine maintenance, including, without limitation, any painting, sealing,
              patching and waterproofing of such walls). Notwithstanding anything in this Paragraph 13 to the contrary, Landlord
              shall have the right to either repair or to require Tenant to repair any damage to any portion of the Premises, the
              Building and/or the Project caused by or created due to any act, omission, negligence or willful misconduct of
              Tenant or Tenant’s Agents and to restore the Premises, the Building and/or the Project, as applicable, to the condition
              existing prior to the occurrence of such damage; provided, however, that in the event Landlord elects to perform
              such repair and restoration work, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for all costs and expenses incurred
              by Landlord in connection therewith. Landlord’s obligation hereunder to repair and maintain is subject to the
              condition precedent that Landlord shall have received written notice of the need for such repairs and maintenance
              and a reasonable time to perform such repair and maintenance. Tenant shall promptly report in writing to Landlord
              any defective condition known to it which Landlord is required to repair, and failure to so report such defects shall
              make Tenant responsible to Landlord for any liability incurred by Landlord by reason of such condition.

                  (c) Tenant’s Waiver of Rights. Tenant hereby expressly waives all rights to make repairs at the expense of
              Landlord or to terminate this Lease, as provided for in California Civil Code Sections 1941 and 1942, and 1932(1),
              respectively, and any similar or successor statute or law in effect or any amendment thereof during the Term.
