                   (a) Tenant shall pay the cost of all water, sewer use, sewer discharge fees and permit costs and sewer connection
              fees, gas, heat, electricity, refuse pickup, janitorial service, telephone and all materials and services or other utilities
              of any kind or nature (collectively, “Utilities”) billed or metered separately to the Premises and/or Tenant, together
              with all taxes, assessments, charges and penalties added to or included within such cost. Tenant acknowledges that
              the Premises, the Building and/or the Project may become subject to the rationing of Utility services or restrictions
              on Utility use as required by a utility company, governmental agency or other similar entity having jurisdiction
              thereof. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that its tenancy, and occupancy hereunder shall be subject to such
              rationing or restrictions as may be imposed upon Landlord, Tenant, the Premises, the Building and/or the Project,
              and Tenant shall in no event be excused or relieved from any covenant or obligation to be kept or performed by
              Tenant by reason of any such rationing or restrictions. Tenant agrees to comply with energy conservation programs
              implemented by Landlord by reason of rationing, restrictions or Laws.
                   (b) Landlord shall not be liable for any loss, injury or damage to property caused by or resulting from any
              variation, interruption, or failure of Utilities due to any cause whatsoever, or from failure to make any repairs or
              perform any maintenance No temporary interruption or failure of such services incident to the making of repairs,
              alterations, improvements, or due to accident, strike, or conditions or other events shall be deemed an eviction of
              Tenant or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations hereunder. In no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any
              damage to the Premises or for any loss, damage or injury to any property therein or thereon occasioned by bursting,
              rupture, leakage or overflow of any plumbing or other pipes (including, without limitation, water, steam, and/or
              refrigerant lines), sprinklers, tanks, drains, drinking fountains or washstands, or other similar cause in, above, upon
              or about the Premises, the Building, or the Project.


                   (c) Without limiting the terms of Paragraph 5(a) above, Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has contracted with
              PG&E to provide electricity for the Building, and that Landlord reserves the right to change the provider of such
              service at any time and from time to time in Landlord’s sole discretion, provided that such change of provider does
              not unreasonably disrupt Tenant’s use of the Premises or materially increase Tenant’s costs (any such provider being
              referred to herein as the “Electric Service Provider”). Tenant shall obtain and accept electrical service for the
              Premises only from and through Landlord, in the manner and to the extent expressly provided in this Lease, at all
              times during the Term of this Lease, and Tenant shall have no right (and hereby waives any right Tenant may
              otherwise have) (i) to contract with or otherwise obtain any electrical service for or with respect to the Premises or
              Tenant’s operations therein from any provider of electrical service other than the Electric Service Provider, or (ii) to
              enter into any separate or direct contract or other similar arrangement with the Electric Service Provider for the
              provision of electrical service to Tenant at the Premises. Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord and the Electric
              Service Provider at all times to facilitate the delivery of electrical service to Tenant at the Premises and to the
              Building, including without limitation allowing Landlord and the Electric Service Provider, and their respective
              agents and contractors, (a) to install, repair, replace, improve and remove any and all electric lines, feeders, risers,
              junction boxes, wiring, and other electrical equipment, machinery and facilities now or hereafter located within the
              Building or the Premises for the purpose of providing electrical service to or within the Premises or the Building,
              and (b) reasonable access for the purpose of maintaining, repairing, replacing or upgrading such electrical service
              from time to time. Tenant shall provide such information and specifications regarding Tenant’s use or projected use
              of electricity at the Premises as shall be required from time to time by Landlord or the Electric Service Provider to
              efficiently provide electrical service to the Premises or the Building. In no event shall Landlord be liable or
              responsible for any loss, damage, expense or liability, including without limitation loss of business or any
              consequential damages, arising from any failure or inadequacy of the electrical service being provided to the
              Premises or the Building, whether resulting from any change, failure, interference, disruption, or defect in the supply
              or character of the electrical service furnished to the Premises or the Building, or arising from the partial or total
              unavailability of electrical service to the Premises or the Building, from any cause whatsoever, or otherwise, nor
              shall any such failure, inadequacy, change, interference, disruption, defect or unavailability constitute an actual or
              constructive eviction of Tenant, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of Rent or otherwise relieve Tenant
              from any of its obligations under this Lease.

                   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph 5(c) above or elsewhere in this Lease, if
              solely as a result of Landlord’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, Landlord fails to provide an Essential
              Service (as hereinafter defined) (an “Abatement Condition”), which failure prevents Tenant from using all or a
              material portion of the Premises (the “Abatement Space”), then Tenant may elect, by notice to Landlord, to have
              Base Rent abate, subject to the following additional conditions having been satisfied in each instance:

                       (1) With respect to the Abatement Condition in question, Tenant shall have given notice to Landlord of the
              occurrence thereof, which notice shall designate the cause or suspected cause of the Abatement Condition, if known
              to Tenant, and the portion of the Premises which is not usable by Tenant, and the Abatement Condition in question
              shall have continued after Tenant has given such notice for a period of not less than ten (10) consecutive days; and



                      (2) Tenant, solely because of the occurrence of the Abatement Condition, shall have actually vacated the
              Abatement Space for not less than ten (10) consecutive days after giving its notice to Landlord of the Abatement
              Condition.

              If, with respect to the Abatement Condition in question, the conditions of this Paragraph 5(d) are fulfilled, then Base
              Rent shall abate, in the proportion that the rentable square foot area of the Abatement Space actually vacated bears
              to the rentable square foot area of the Premises, for a period equal to the lesser of (A) the period during which
              Tenant has actually vacated the Abatement Space, or (B) the period of time between Tenant’s having vacated the
              Abatement Space and the date Tenant receives notice from Landlord that the Abatement Condition has been cured,
              provided that such time periods shall not commence to run until the day after Tenant gives Landlord notice of the
              Abatement Condition as required above. For purposes of this Paragraph 5(d), vacation of the Abatement Space shall
              not require Tenant to remove furniture, fixtures or equipment. Tenant shall be deemed to have vacated the
              Abatement Space if, due to the Abatement Condition, the Abatement Space is not usable by Tenant, and Tenant does
              not in fact conduct any business in or use the Abatement Space. Tenant agrees that furnishing Landlord with notice
              of the Abatement Condition shall be an election of remedies, and Tenant shall be deemed to have waived any other
              rights against Landlord at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, an action for money damages in connection
              with the Abatement Condition in question. Nothing contained herein shall limit Tenant’s right to an abatement of
              Base Rent or termination of this Lease in the event of a casualty as provided in Paragraph 21 hereof. For purposes
              hereof, an “Essential Service” shall mean the services to be provided by the heating, ventilation and air
              conditioning systems, life safety systems, mechanical systems, plumbing and waste disposal systems and electrical
              systems to the extent Landlord is required to provide such services pursuant to this Paragraph 5.
