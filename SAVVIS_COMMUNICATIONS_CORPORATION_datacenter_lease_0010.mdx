              10. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.
                   10.1 Restrictions on Transfers; Landlord’s Consent. Tenant shall not sublease all or any part of the Tenant
              Space, nor assign this Lease, nor enter any other agreement (a) permitting a third party (other than Tenant’s
              employees and occasional guests) to occupy or use any portion of the Tenant Space or (b) otherwise assigning,
              transferring, mortgaging, pledging, hypothecating, encumbering or permitting a lien to attach to its interest under
              this Lease (any such assignment, sublease or the like may sometimes be referred to herein as a “Transfer” and any
              person or entity to whom a Transfer is made or sought to be made is referred to herein as a “Transferee”), without
              Landlord’s express prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
              No Transfer (whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law) shall be valid or effective without Landlord’s
              prior written consent and, at Landlord’s election, any Transfer or attempted Transfer shall constitute an Event of
              Default of this Lease. Except as set forth in Section 10.6 hereof, Tenant expressly covenants and agrees not to enter
              into (and acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to enter into) any Transfer which expressly, implicitly, or
              effectively amounts to or is the equivalent of a sublease or other arrangement which creates a co-location between
              Tenant and any Transferee (any such Transfer a “Sub-Co-location Arrangement”) without the prior written consent
              of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that any such Sub-
              Co-Location Arrangement shall be subject to the terms, conditions and procedures set forth in said Section 10.6.

                         10.1.1 Permitted Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant may, without
              the consent of Landlord (and without being subject to Landlord’s rights under Sections 10.4 and 10.6, below)
              (a) undertake the transfer or assignment of interests in Tenant, including, without limitation, the transfer of any or all
              of the outstanding voting or non-voting stock, the sale of substantially all of Tenant’s assets, or the issuance of new
              shares of voting or non-voting stock of Tenant which shall not be deemed an assignment of this Lease provided such
              action is taken pursuant to a bona fide business transaction and not principally or exclusively as a means to evade
              the consent requirements under the Lease and further provided that the Tangible Net Worth (as defined below) of the
              tenant under this Lease after such acquisition is not less than the Tangible Net Worth of Tenant as of the Effective
              Date; and/or (b) effect Affiliate Transfers (as defined below) (in any such event, a “Permitted Transfer”). An
              “Affiliate Transfer” means (i) an assignment by Tenant of this Lease to a Tenant Affiliate (as defined below), or
              (ii) an assignment by Tenant of this Lease in connection with a corporate reorganization provided the board of
              directors of the entity resulting from such corporate reorganization is controlled by directors representing the
              interests of the undersigned Tenant as it existed prior to such reorganization, if (x) Tenant gives Landlord prior
              written notice of the name of any such assignee, (y) the assignee assumes, in writing, for the benefit of Landlord all
              of Tenant’s obligations under the Lease, and (z) (except in the case of an assignment to a Tenant Affiliate) the
              Tangible Net Worth of the surviving or created entity is not less than the Tangible Net Worth of Tenant as of the

                                                                           -17-





                                                                                                                                 Page

              Effective Date. The term “Tenant Affiliate” as used herein shall mean any partnership, limited liability company, or
              corporation or other entity, directly or indirectly, which through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled
              by, or is under common control with Tenant. The term “control”, as used in the immediately preceding sentence
              shall mean with respect to a corporation the right to exercise, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of
              the voting rights attributable to the controlled corporation or the power to elect a majority of its Board of Directors.
              The term “Tangible Net Worth” as used herein shall mean the excess of total assets over total liabilities (in each
              case, determined in accordance with GAAP) excluding from the determination of total assets all assets which would
              be classified as intangible assets under GAAP, including, without limitation, goodwill, licenses, patents, trademarks,
              trade names, copyrights, and franchises.

                   10.2 Notice to Landlord. If Tenant desires to make any Transfer (other than a Permitted Transfer, for which
              Tenant must notify Landlord within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of same), then at least twenty (20) days
              (but no more than one hundred eighty (180) days) prior to the proposed effective date of the proposed Transfer,
              Tenant shall submit to Landlord a written request (a “Transfer Notice”) for Landlord’s consent, which notice shall
              include: (i) a statement containing: (a) the name and address of the proposed Transferee; (b) current, certified
              financial statements of the proposed Transferee, and any other information and materials (including, without
              limitation, credit reports, business plans, operating history, bank and character references) required by Landlord to
              assist Landlord in reviewing the financial responsibility, character, and reputation of the proposed Transferee; (c) all
              of the principal terms of the proposed Transfer; and (d) such other information and materials as Landlord may
              reasonably request (and if Landlord requests such additional information or materials, the Transfer Notice shall not
              be deemed to have been received until Landlord receives such additional information or materials) and (ii) four
              (4) originals of the proposed assignment or other Transfer on a form reasonably approved by Landlord and executed
              by Tenant and the proposed Transferee. If Tenant modifies any of the terms and conditions relevant to a proposed
              Transfer specified in the Transfer Notice, Tenant shall re-submit such Transfer Notice to Landlord for its consent
              pursuant to all of the terms and conditions of this Article 10.

                   10.3 Intentionally Deleted.

                   10.4 No Release; Subsequent Transfers. No Transfer (whether or not a Permitted Transfer) will release Tenant
              from Tenant’s obligations under this Lease or alter the primary liability of Tenant to pay the Rent and to perform all
              other obligations to be performed by Tenant hereunder. In no event shall the acceptance of any payment by Landlord
              from any other person be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision hereof. Consent by Landlord to one
              Transfer will not be deemed consent to any subsequent Transfer. In the event of breach by any Transferee of Tenant
              or any successor of Tenant in the performance of any of the terms hereof, Landlord may proceed directly against
              Tenant without the necessity of exhausting remedies against such Transferee or successor. The voluntary or other
              surrender of this Lease by Tenant or a mutual termination thereof shall not work as a merger and shall, at the option
              of Landlord, either (i) terminate all and any existing agreements effecting a Transfer, or (ii) operate as an assignment
              to Landlord of Tenant’s interest under any or all such agreements.

                   10.5 Landlord’s Costs. With respect to each Transfer proposed to be consummated by Tenant, whether or not
              Landlord shall grant consent, Tenant shall pay all of Landlord’s reasonable review and processing fees, and
              reasonable costs, as well as any good faith reasonable professional, attorneys’, accountants’, engineers’ or other
              consultants’ fees incurred by Landlord relating to such proposed Transfer within ten (10) days after written request
              therefor by Landlord, to the extent that such fees and costs exceed $500.00.

                   10.6 Colocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord acknowledges that the business to be conducted by
              the undersigned Tenant in the Premises requires the installation of certain equipment (described below) owned by
              customers or co-locators or sub-co-locators of the undersigned Tenant (“Permitted Licensees”) in (but not outside
              of) the Premises, in order for the Permitted Licensees to access certain portions of the Premises and to place and
              maintain computer, switch and/or communications equipment therein
                                                               Data Center Lease




                                                                           -18-





                                                                                                                                Page

              which may interconnect with Tenant’s facilities and/or the Permitted Licensees’ facilities (the “Permitted
              Interconnection”). To expedite the Permitted Licensees’ access to the Premises for the Permitted Interconnection,
              Landlord expressly agrees that Tenant may, without Landlord’s further consent, license portions of the Premises to
              the Permitted Licensees for the sole purpose of the Permitted Interconnection pursuant to written agreements by and
              between Tenant and the Permitted Licensees providing for (i) the installation in the Premises of communications
              and/or computer equipment owned or leased by third parties (including communications and/or computer equipment
              leased by Tenant to such third parties) to enable Tenant to provide such third parties with broadband connectivity to
              the internet, IP VPN services, web hosting and/or all other internet, intranet and extranet facilities and equipment
              and/or services then currently being provided by Tenant; (ii) the use, maintenance, repair, and operation of such
              communications and/or computer equipment by such third parties and/or by Tenant; and (iii) a grant by Tenant to
              such third parties of the right to have actual and/or virtual access to the Premises and to such communications and/or
              computer equipment (collectively, “Permitted Colocation Agreements”); provided, however, that (a) Tenant
              provides a list of contact information for such Permitted Licensees in a format that Landlord may reasonably alter
              from time-to-time, (b) Tenant pays to Landlord as Additional Rent Landlord’s prevailing fee for each Permitted
              Licensee (the “Access Card Fee”) for the purpose of providing the Permitted Licensee with access to the
              Colocation Room, which Access Card Fee, as of the date of this Lease, is $35 per access card and is subject to
              increases from time-to-time during the Term of this Lease, and (c) the Permitted Licensee’s license of a portion of
              the Premises may not violate the terms of this Lease or any Applicable Laws. Landlord expressly waives its right to
              prior review of such Permitted Colocation Agreements. Tenant’s Permitted Colocation Agreements with the
              Permitted Licensees may not affect, or provide any rights with respect to or to use in any manner, the Pathway as
              defined in Item 7.c. of the Basic Lease Information or Tenant’s interconnections. The Permitted Licensees shall
              comply with all Applicable Laws and the Building Rules and Regulations. The Permitted Colocation Agreements
              and the Permitted Licensees’ rights thereunder shall be subject and subordinate at all times to the Lease and all of its
              provisions, covenants and condition. Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord and the
              Landlord Group from and against (and to reimburse Landlord and the Landlord Group) for any and all Claims
              (defined in Section 14.2, below) arising from or in any manner relating to (i) any Permitted Colocation Agreement,
              (ii) the use or occupancy of the Tenant Space or any other portion of the Building or the Property by any Permitted
              Licensee or any person claiming by, through or under any Permitted Licensee, its partners, and their respective
              officers, agents, servants or employees of Tenant or any such person (collectively, the “Colocating Parties”), or
              (iii) the acts or omissions of any Permitted Licensee or any Colocating Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
              Permitted Colocation Agreements may be effected whether or not Tenant provides managed hosting services to the
              Colocation Party; provided that the terms of this Section 10.6 are complied with. Permitted Colocation Agreements
              shall not constitute or be deemed the grant of a leasehold interest or otherwise constitute or be deemed a real
              property interest.
