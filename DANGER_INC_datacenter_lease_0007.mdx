              10. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.
                    10.1 Restrictions on Transfers; Landlord’s Consent. Tenant shall not sublease all or any part of the Tenant Space, nor
              assign this Lease, nor enter any other agreement (a) permitting a third party (other than Tenant, Tenant Parties or Tenant’s
              occasional guests) to occupy or use any portion of the Tenant Space or (b) otherwise assigning, transferring, mortgaging,
              pledging, hypothecating, encumbering or permitting a lien to attach to its interest under this Lease (any such assignment,
              sublease or the like may sometimes be referred to herein as a “Transfer” and any person or entity to whom a Transfer is made
              or sought to be made is referred to herein as a “Transferee”), without Landlord’s express prior written consent, which consent
              shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. No Transfer (whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of
              law) shall be valid or effective without Landlord’s prior written consent and, at Landlord’s election, any Transfer or attempted
              Transfer shall constitute an Event of Default of this Lease. Except as set forth in Section 10.5, below, Tenant expressly
              covenants and agrees not to enter into (and acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to enter into) any Transfer which
              expressly, implicitly, or effectively amounts to or is the equivalent of a sublease or other arrangement which creates a co-
              location between Tenant and any Transferee (any such Transfer a “Sub-Co-location Arrangement”) without the prior written
              consent of Landlord which, in such circumstances, may be granted or withheld by Landlord for any reason or for no reason in
              the exercise of Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion (and Tenant agrees that it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold
              its consent to any Transfer which would amount to or create the equivalent of a Sub-Co-location Arrangement).






                         10.1.1 Permitted Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant may, without the consent
              of Landlord (and without being subject to Landlord’s rights under Section 10.3, below) (a) undertake the transfer or assignment
              of interests in Tenant, including, without limitation, the transfer of any or all of the outstanding voting or non-voting stock or
              the issuance of new shares of voting or non-voting stock of Tenant which shall not be deemed an assignment of this Lease
              provided such action is taken pursuant to a bona fide business transaction and not principally or exclusively as a means to
              evade the consent requirements under this Lease and further provided that the credit of the Tenant under this Lease after such
              acquisition is deemed to be sufficient in Landlord’s sole reasonable determination; and/or (b) effect Affiliate Transfers (as
              defined below) (in either event, a “Permitted Transfer”). An “Affiliate Transfer” means (i) an assignment by Tenant of this
              Lease to a Tenant Affiliate (as defined below), or (ii) an assignment by Tenant of this Lease in connection with a corporate
              reorganization provided the board of directors of the entity resulting from such corporate reorganization is controlled by
              directors representing the interests of the undersigned Tenant as it existed prior to such reorganization, if (x) Tenant gives
              Landlord prior written notice of the name of any such assignee, (y) the assignee assumes, in writing, for the benefit of Landlord
              all of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, and (z) (except in the case of an assignment to a Tenant Affiliate) the credit of the
              surviving or created entity is deemed to be sufficient in Landlord’s sole reasonable determination. The term “Tenant Affiliate”
              as used herein shall mean any partnership, limited liability company, or corporation or other entity, directly or indirectly, which
              through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Tenant. The term “control”, as
              used in the immediately preceding sentence shall mean with respect to a corporation the right to exercise, directly or indirectly,
              fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting rights attributable to the controlled corporation or the power to elect a majority of its
              Board of Directors.

                   10.2 Notice to Landlord. If Tenant desires to make any Transfer (other than a Permitted Transfer, for which Tenant must
              notify Landlord within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of same), then at least ten (10) days (but no more than one
              hundred eighty (180) days) prior to the proposed effective date of the proposed Transfer, Tenant shall submit to Landlord a
              written request (a “Transfer Notice”) for Landlord’s consent, which notice shall include: (i) a statement containing: (a) the
              name and address of the proposed Transferee; (b) current, certified financial statements of the proposed Transferee, and any
              other information and materials (including, without limitation, credit reports, business plans, operating history, bank and
              character references) reasonably required by Landlord to assist Landlord in reviewing the financial responsibility, character,
              and reputation of the proposed Transferee; (c) all of the principal terms of the proposed Transfer; and (d) such other
              information and materials as Landlord may reasonably request (and if Landlord requests such additional information or
              materials, the Transfer Notice shall not be deemed to have been received until Landlord receives such additional information or
              materials) and (ii) four (4) originals of the proposed assignment or other Transfer on a form reasonably approved by Landlord
              and four (4) originals of the Landlord’s standard form of “Assignment and Assumption of Lease and Consent” or other Transfer
              documentation executed by Tenant and the proposed Transferee. If Tenant materially modifies any of the terms and conditions
              relevant to a proposed Transfer specified in the Transfer Notice, Tenant shall re-submit such Transfer Notice to Landlord for its
              consent pursuant to all of the terms and conditions of this Article 10.

                    10.3 Landlord’s Recapture Rights. Except with regard to a Permitted Transfer, at any time within twenty (20) business
              days after Landlord’s receipt of all (but not less than all) of the information and documents described in Section 10.2, Landlord
              shall have the right (but no obligation), exercisable by written notice to Tenant, to elect to cancel and terminate this Lease.

                   10.4 No Release; Subsequent Transfers. No Transfer (whether or not a Permitted Transfer) will release Tenant from
              Tenant’s obligations under this Lease or alter the primary liability of Tenant to pay the Rent and to perform all other obligations
              to be performed by Tenant hereunder. In no event shall the acceptance of any payment by Landlord from any other person be
              deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision hereof. Consent by Landlord to one Transfer will not be deemed consent
              to any subsequent Transfer. In the event of breach by any Transferee of Tenant or any successor of Tenant in the performance of
              any of the terms hereof, Landlord may proceed directly against Tenant without the necessity of exhausting remedies against
              such Transferee or successor. The voluntary or other surrender of

 
              this Lease by Tenant or a mutual termination thereof shall not work as a merger and shall, at the option of Landlord, either
              (i) terminate all and any existing agreements effecting a Transfer, or (ii) operate as an assignment to Landlord of Tenant’s
              interest under any or all such agreements

                    10.5 Colocation. Landlord acknowledges that the business to be conducted by the undersigned Tenant in the Premises
              requires the installation of certain equipment (described below) owned by customers or co-locators of the undersigned Tenant
              (“Permitted Licensees”) in (but not outside of) the Premises, in order for the Permitted Licensees to place and maintain
              computer, switch and/or communications equipment which may interconnect with Tenant’s facilities and/or the Permitted
              Licensees’ facilities (the “Permitted Interconnection”). To expedite the Permitted Licensees’ access to the Premises for the
              Permitted Interconnection, Landlord expressly agrees that Tenant may, without Landlord’s further consent, license portions of
              the Premises to the Permitted Licensees for the sole purpose of the Permitted Interconnection pursuant to written agreements by
              and between Tenant and the Permitted Licensees (collectively, “Permitted Agreements”); provided, however, that (a) Tenant
              provides a list of contact information for such Permitted Licensees in a format that Landlord may reasonably alter from time-
              to-time, and (b) each Permitted Licensee’s license of a portion of the Premises may not violate any terms of this Lease or any
              Applicable Laws. Landlord expressly waives any right to prior review of such Permitted Agreements. Tenant’s Permitted
              Agreements with the Permitted Licensees may not affect, or provide any rights with respect to or to use in any manner, the
              Additional Pathway as defined in Item 7 of the Basic Lease Information or Tenant’s interconnections. The Permitted Licensees
              shall comply with all Applicable Laws and the Datacenter Rules and Regulations. The Permitted Agreements and the Permitted
              Licensees’ rights thereunder shall be subject and subordinate at all times to the Lease and all of its provisions, covenants and
              conditions. Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord and the Landlord Group from and against
              (and to reimburse Landlord and the Landlord Group) for any and all Claims (defined in Section 14.2, below) arising from or in
              any manner relating to (i) any Permitted Agreement, (ii) the use or occupancy of the Tenant Space or any other portion of the
              Building or the Property by any Permitted Licensee or any person claiming by, through or under any Permitted Licensee, its
              partners, and their respective officers, agents, servants or employees of Tenant or any such person (collectively, the
              “Colocating Parties”) pursuant to any Permitted Agreement, (ii) the acts or omissions of any Permitted Licensee or any
              Colocating Parties pursuant to any Permitted Agreement.

              11. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE BY TENANT. At any time and from time to time, within ten (10) business days after
              written request by Landlord, Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord a statement in writing certifying all
              matters reasonably requested by Landlord or any current or prospective purchaser, Holder (as defined in Section 12.1 below) of
              any Security Document (as defined in Section 12.1 below), ground lessor or master lessor. Tenant acknowledges and agrees
              that it understands that any statement delivered (or to be delivered) pursuant to this Article 11 may be relied upon by any
              prospective purchaser of the Building or the Property or by any prospective mortgagee, ground lessor or other like
              encumbrancer thereof or any assignee of any such encumbrance upon the Building or the Property. Tenant’s failure to deliver
              the statement within the ten (10) business day period specified above shall be conclusive and binding upon Tenant with respect
              to a third party that the Lease is in full force and effect without modification except as may be represented by Landlord, that
              there are no uncured defaults in Landlord’s performance and that Tenant has no right of offset, counterclaim or deduction
              against any fees or other charges due Landlord hereunder, and that no more than one month’s fees or other charges due
              hereunder have been paid in advance.

              12. SUBORDINATION AND ATTORNMENT; LENDER RIGHTS.
                    12.1 Subordination and Attornment. Without the necessity of any additional document being executed by Tenant for the
              purpose of effecting a subordination, and at the election of Landlord or any mortgagee or beneficiary with a mortgage or deed
              of trust encumbering the Property or any portion thereof, or any lessor of a ground or underlying lease with respect to the
              Property or any portion thereof (any such mortgagee, beneficiary or lessor, a “Holder”), this Lease will be subject and
              subordinate at all times to: (i) all ground leases or underlying leases which may now exist or hereafter be executed affecting the
              Property; (ii) the lien of any mortgage, deed or deed of trust which may now exist or hereafter be




              executed affecting the Property or any portion thereof; (iii) all past and future advances made under any such mortgages, deeds
              or deeds of trust; and (iv) all renewals, modifications, replacements and extensions of any such ground leases, master leases,
              mortgages, deed and deeds of trust (collectively, “Security Documents”) which may now exist or hereafter be executed which
              constitute a lien upon or affect the Property or any portion thereof, or Landlord’s interest and estate in any of said items.
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord reserves the right to subordinate any such Security Documents to this Lease. In the
              event of any termination or transfer of Landlord’s estate or interest in the Property, the Building, the Datacenter or the Tenant
              Space by reason of any termination or foreclosure of any such Security Documents (and notwithstanding any subordination of
              such Security Document to this Lease that may or may not have occurred), at the election of Landlord’s successor in interest,
              Tenant agrees to attorn to and become the tenant of such successor, in which event Tenant’s right to possession of the Property
              will not be disturbed as long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease. Tenant hereby waives any right under any Applicable
              Law or otherwise to terminate or otherwise adversely affect this Lease and the obligations of Tenant hereunder in the event of
              any termination or transfer of Landlord’s estate or interest in the Property, the Building, the Datacenter or the Tenant Space by
              reason of any termination or foreclosure of any such Security Documents. Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver,
              within ten (10) business days of receipt thereof, and in the form reasonably required by Landlord or in the standard form
              required by any Holder, any additional documents evidencing the priority or subordination of this Lease and Tenant’s
              agreement to attorn with respect to any such Security Document; provided, however, any such agreement subordinating this
              Lease to such lease, mortgage or deed of trust shall contain a nondisturbance provision in the standard form of such Holder.

                    12.2 Mortgagee and Ground Lessor Protection. Tenant agrees to give each Holder, by registered or certified mail, a
              copy of any notice of default served upon the Landlord by Tenant, provided that prior to such notice Tenant has been notified in
              writing of the address of such Holder (hereafter, a “Noticed Holder”). Tenant further agrees that if Landlord shall have failed
              to cure such default within thirty (30) days after such notice to Landlord (or if such default cannot be cured or corrected within
              that time, then within such additional time as may be necessary if Landlord has commenced such cure within such thirty
              (30) days and is diligently pursuing the remedies or steps necessary to cure or correct such default), then prior to Tenant
              pursuing any remedy for such default provided hereunder, at law or in equity, any Noticed Holder shall have an additional
              thirty (30) days within which to cure or correct such default (or if such default cannot reasonably be cured or corrected within
              that time, then such additional time as may be necessary if the Noticed Holder has commenced within such thirty (30) days and
              is diligently pursuing the remedies or steps necessary to cure or correct such default).

                    12.3 SNDA. At any time that the Building is made subject to any Security Document(s), Landlord shall use commercially
              reasonable good faith efforts to cause the mortgagee and any lessor (whether under a ground or master lease) to deliver to
              Tenant a subordination, attornment and non-disturbance agreement reasonably acceptable to Tenant (the “SNDA”), providing
              that so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease after the expiration of any applicable notice and cure periods, Tenant
              may remain in possession of the Tenant Space under the terms of this Lease, even if the mortgagee or its successor should
              acquire Landlord’s title to the Building. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the subordination of this Lease to any
              Security Document now or hereafter placed upon the Building and Tenant’s agreement to attorn to the Holder as provided in
              this Section 12 shall be conditioned upon the Holder providing Tenant with a commercially reasonable SNDA.

              13. SURRENDER OF TENANT SPACE; HOLDING OVER.
                    13.1 Tenant’s Method of Surrender. Upon the expiration of the Term of this Lease, or upon any earlier termination of
              this Lease or the termination of Tenant’s right to possess the Tenant Space, Tenant shall, subject to the provisions of this
              Article 13 and Section 8.4, quit and surrender possession of the Tenant Space to Landlord in the same condition as received,
              reasonable wear and tear excepted. If Tenant fails to surrender the Tenant Space upon the expiration or any earlier termination
              of this Lease or the termination of Tenant’s right to possess the Tenant Space in accordance with the terms of this Lease, then
              Tenant shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold the Landlord Group harmless from, and shall


              reimburse Landlord for its first-party losses, costs and expenses in connection with, all Claims (including, without limitation,
              costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in returning the Tenant Space to the condition in which Tenant was to surrender and
              Claims made by any succeeding tenant founded on or resulting from Tenant’s failure to surrender the Tenant Space) arising out
              of or in any manner relating to such failure to quit and surrender possession of the Tenant Space to Landlord in the condition
              required hereunder upon such date.

                    13.2 Disposal of Tenant’s Personal Property. If any property not belonging to Landlord remains in the Tenant Space
              after the expiration of or within thirty (30) days after any earlier termination of the Term of this Lease or the termination of
              Tenant’s right to possess the Tenant Space, Tenant shall be deemed to have abandoned such property and to have authorized
              Landlord to make such disposition of such property as Landlord may desire without liability for compensation or damages to
              Tenant in the event that such property is the property of Tenant; and in the event that such property is the property of someone
              other than Tenant, Tenant shall indemnify and hold the Landlord Group harmless from all Claims arising out of, in connection
              with, or in any manner related to any removal, exercise or dominion over and/or disposition of such property by Landlord. The
              foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any lender of Tenant’s with whom Landlord has entered into an agreement regarding the
              disposal of personal property in situations where Landlord has breached its obligations under such agreement with such lender;
              in such cases, the terms of the agreement between Landlord and Tenant’s lender shall control.

                    13.3 Holding Over. If Tenant should remain in possession of all or any portion of the Tenant Space after the expiration of
              the Term of this Lease (or any earlier termination of this Lease or the termination of Tenant’s right to possess the Tenant
              Space), without the execution by Landlord and Tenant of a new lease or an extension of the Term of this Lease, then Tenant
              shall be deemed to be occupying the entire Tenant Space as a tenant-at-sufferance, upon all of the terms contained herein,
              except as to term and Base Rent and any other provision reasonably determined by Landlord to be inapplicable. During any
              such holdover period, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a monthly Base Rent in an amount equal to two hundred percent (200%) of
              the Base Rent and Additional Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord during the last month of the Term of this Lease. The monthly
              rent payable for such holdover period shall in no event be construed as a penalty or as liquidated damages for such retention of
              possession. Neither any provision hereof nor any acceptance by Landlord of any rent after any such expiration or earlier
              termination shall be deemed a consent to any holdover hereunder or result in a renewal of this Lease or an extension of the
              Term, or any waiver of any of Landlord’s rights or remedies with respect to such holdover. Notwithstanding any provision to
              the contrary contained herein, (a) Landlord expressly reserves the right to require Tenant to surrender possession of the Tenant
              Space upon the expiration of the Term of this Lease or upon the earlier termination hereof or at any time during any holdover
              and the right to assert any remedy at law or in equity to evict Tenant and collect damages in connection with any such holdover,
              and (b) Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold the Landlord Group harmless from and against any and all Claims (excluding
              all lost profits and other consequential damages), attorneys’ fees, consultants’ fees and court costs incurred or suffered by or
              asserted against Landlord arising out of or in any manner related to Tenant’s failure to surrender the Tenant Space upon the
              expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or upon termination of Tenant’s right to possess the Tenant Space in accordance
              with the provisions of this Lease.

                   13.4 Survival. The provisions of this Article 13 shall survive the expiration or early termination of this Lease.
