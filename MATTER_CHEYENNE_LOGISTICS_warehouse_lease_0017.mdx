                               25.21     Covenants and Conditions. Each provision to be performed by either party
                                         hereunder shall be deemed to be both a covenant and a condition.





                               25.22     Consents. Except as otherwise provided elsewhere in this Lease, Landlord's
                                         actual reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, architects',
                                         attorneys', engineers' and other consultants' fees) incurred in the consideration
                                         of, or response to, a request by Tenant for any Landlord consent, including but
                                         not limited to, consents to an assignment, a subletting or the presence or use of a
                                         Hazardous Material, shall be paid by Tenant upon receipt of an invoice and
                                         supporting documentation therefor.
                               25.23     Force Majeure. "Force Majeure" as used in this Lease means delays resulting
                                         from causes beyond the reasonable control of Landlord or Tenant (as applicable),
                                         including, without limitation, any delay caused by any action, inaction, order,
                                         ruling, moratorium, regulation, statute, condition or other decision of any private
                                         party or governmental agency having jurisdiction over any portion of the
                                         Project, over the construction anticipated to occur thereon or over any uses
                                         thereof, or by delays in inspections or in issuing approvals by private parties or
                                         permits by governmental agencies, or by fire, flood, inclement weather, strikes,
                                         lockouts or other labor or industrial disturbance, failure or inability to secure
                                         materials, supplies or labor through ordinary sources, epidemic/pandemic,
                                         quarantine, other health risks, including, but not

                                         similar body, earthquake, or other natural disaster, or any cause whatsoever
                                         beyond the reasonable control (excluding financial inability) of the Landlord or
                                         Tenant, or any of its contractors or other representatives, whether or not similar
                                         to any of the causes hereinabove stated.



                               25.24     OFAC. Tenant hereby represents, warrants and certifies that: (i) neither it nor its
                                         officers, directors, or controlling owners is acting, directly or indirectly, for or on

                                         United States Department of Justice, or the United States Treasury Department
                                         as a terrorist, “Specifically Designated National or Blocked Person,” or other
                                         banned or blocked person, entity, nation, or transaction pursuant to any law,
                                         order, rule or regulation that is enforced or administered by the Office of Foreign
                                         Assets Control (“SDN”); (ii) neither it nor its officers, directors or controlling
                                         owners is engaged in this transaction, directly or indirectly on behalf of, or
                                         instigating or facilitating this transaction, directly or indirectly on behalf of, any
                                         such person, group, entity, or nation; and (iii) neither it nor its officers, directors
                                         or controlling owners is in violation of Presidential Executive Order 13224, the
                                         USA PATRIOT Act, (Public Law 107-56), the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money
                                         Laundering Control Act or any regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. If the
                                         foregoing representations are untrue at any time during the Lease Term, an Event
                                         of Default will be deemed to have occurred, without the necessity of notice to
                                         Tenant. The provisions of this Paragraph shall survive the expiration or earlier
                                         termination of this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have no
                                         obligation to make, and does not make, the foregoing representations, warranties
                                         or certifications with respect to its owners so long as Tenant’s stock is publicly
                                         traded.
                               25.25     Roof Use by Landlord. Landlord reserves the right to use the surface of the roof
                                         in any manner which does not materially interfere with Tenant's use of the
                                         Premises including, but not limited to, installation of telecommunication
                                         equipment, solar equipment or any other uses.
                               25.26     Parking. Unless otherwise directed by Landlord, Tenant shall have the right to
                                         park in common with other tenants of the Project in those areas designated by
                                         Landlord for nonreserved parking. During the Term, Tenant shall have the non-
                                         exclusive right to use a total of seventy-five (75) unreserved vehicular parking
                                         spaces, as parking available for the Building is generally shown on Exhibit K
                                         attached hereto. If Tenant requires additional parking during the approximate
                                         two-week period around “cyber week” each year, Landlord agrees to use best
                                         efforts to make twenty (20) to thirty (30) additional parking spaces available to
                                         Tenant, subject to availability and provided that Tenant gives Landlord
                                         reasonable prior notice of such parking requirement. Tenant agrees not to
                                         overburden the parking facilities and agrees to cooperate with Landlord and
                                         other tenants in the use of parking facilities. Landlord may, but is not obligated





                                         to, designate exclusive parking spaces for Tenant and other tenants within the
                                         Project if Landlord reasonably determines that such designation is necessary.
                                         Landlord shall not be responsible for enforcing Tenant's parking rights against
                                         any third parties, but shall use good faith efforts to enforce such Rules or
                                         Regulations on behalf of all tenants. The parking spaces shall be used for
                                         parking by vehicles no larger than full-size passenger automobiles, SUV’s or
                                         pick-up trucks (“Permitted Size Vehicles”). Vehicles other than Permitted Size
                                         Vehicles shall be parked and loaded or unloaded as directed by Landlord. Tenant
                                         shall not permit or allow any vehicles that belong to or are controlled by Tenant
                                         or Tenant’s employees, suppliers, shippers, customers, contractors or invitees to
                                         be loaded, unloaded, or parked in areas other than those designated by Landlord
                                         for such activities. If Tenant permits or allows any of the prohibited activities
                                         described in this Section, then Landlord shall have the right, without notice, in
                                         addition to such other rights and remedies that it may have, to remove or tow
                                         away the vehicle involved and charge the cost to Tenant, which cost shall be
                                         immediately payable upon demand by Landlord. No vehicle or equipment of any
                                         kind shall be dismantled or repaired or serviced on the Common Area.

                               25.27     Common Area. The term “Common Area” means all areas from time to time
                                         designated by Landlord for the general and nonexclusive common use or benefit
                                         of Tenant, other tenants of the Project, and Landlord, including, without
                                         limitation, roadways, entrances and exits, loading areas, landscaped areas, open
                                         areas, park areas, service drives, walkways, common trash areas, vending or
                                         mail areas, common pipes, conduits, wires and appurtenant equipment within the
                                         Project, maintenance and utility rooms and closets, exterior lighting, exterior
                                         utility lines, and parking facilities. Tenant and its employees and visitors shall
                                         have the non-exclusive right to use any Common Areas of the Project as
                                         constituted from time to time, subject to such reasonable rules and regulations
                                         governing the use as Landlord from time to time may prescribe. Notwithstanding
                                         anything contained herein to the contrary, Landlord shall have the right to
                                         designate certain portions of the Common Areas (including, but not limited to,
                                         areas adjacent to a tenant’s premises and/or trailer parking areas located
                                         throughout the Project) for the exclusive use of one or more tenants, so long as,
                                         in Landlord’s determination, such designation does not materially adversely
                                         impact the rights of any other tenant within the Project. Landlord as part of the
                                         management fees under the Operating Expenses shall use good faith efforts to
                                         enforce the Rules or Regulations for the benefit of the Tenant. Landlord shall not
                                         be responsible for non-compliance by any other tenant or occupant of the Project
                                         with, or Landlord's failure to enforce, any of the Rules or Regulations or CC&Rs
                                         or any other terms or provisions of such tenant's or occupant's lease. Tenant shall
                                         promptly comply with the reasonable requirements of any board of fire
                                         insurance underwriters or other similar body now or hereafter constituted. Under
                                         no circumstances shall the right herein granted to use the Common Area be
                                         deemed to include the right to store any property, temporarily or permanently, in
                                         the Common Area. In the event that any unauthorized storage shall occur, then
                                         Landlord shall have the right, without notice, in addition to such other rights and
                                         remedies that it may have, to remove the property and charge the cost to Tenant,
                                         which cost shall be immediately payable upon demand by Landlord. Landlord
                                         may change the shape and size of the Common Areas, including the addition of,
                                         elimination of or change to any improvements located in the Common Areas, so
                                         long as such change does not materially adversely affect Tenant’s ability to use
                                         the Premises for the Permitted Use.
                               25.28     Counterparts. This Lease may be executed in counterparts and shall constitute
                                         an agreement binding on all parties notwithstanding that all parties are not
                                         signatories to the original or the same counterpart provided that all parties are
                                         furnished a copy or copies thereof reflecting the signature of all parties.
                                         Transmission of a facsimile or by email of a pdf copy of the signed counterpart
                                         of the Lease shall be deemed the equivalent of the delivery of the original, and
                                         any party so delivering a facsimile or pdf copy of the signed counterpart of the
                                         Lease by email transmission shall in all events deliver to the other party an
                                         original signature promptly upon request.
                               25.29     Light and Air. This Lease does not grant any rights to light or air over or about
                                         the Building. Landlord excepts and reserves exclusively to itself any and all





                                         rights not specifically granted to Tenant under this Lease.
