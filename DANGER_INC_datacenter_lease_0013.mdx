                   A.   Datacenter access is restricted to personnel with an approved business need. Only designated Tenant Authorizers may
                        approve an individual’s access into the Datacenter.
                   B.   Card access doors control admittance to the Datacenter. Never loan your badge or use another person’s badge for any
                        purpose. Failure to comply will cause your removal from the site.
                   C.   If you should lose your ID badge, immediately report it to Building Security so it can be deactivated.
                   D.   Do not allow others to tailgate into a controlled space behind you. Tailgating is a way for someone who lacks
                        authorization to enter a restricted space. Each person must use the badge access system to facilitate their own access
                        by use of their own badge. Conversely, you must not follow another person into any restricted space without having
                        separately used your own badge to unlock the door into that space.
                   E.   The badge access system may require that you pass your badge by a reader in order to exit the Datacenter. This
                        process will provide greater awareness of occupancy in the event of an emergency.
                   F.   Do not attempt to enter areas to which you are not authorized.
                   G.   The Datacenter is under 24-hour closed circuit TV cameras surveillance. Cameras are deployed within the Datacenter
                        and surrounding areas to monitor the security of exits and entrances. Activity viewed by these cameras is recorded
                        and may be used for investigative purposes or when a security policy, such as tailgating, is violated.
                   H.   Tampering with the camera equipment is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate dismissal from the Building.
                   I.   Emergency power-off (EPO) buttons are located adjacent to the exit doors within the Datacenter for use in an
                        absolute emergency situation where the shutdown of power is necessary to prevent loss of life or to prevent the
                        spread of a significant electrical fire.
                   J.   The room is secured with a “fail-safe” access control system utilizing either access card and/or biometric based.
                   K.   All doors into the Datacenter and other restricted space must not be propped open for any length of time. You should
                        ensure that each controlled access door closes immediately after you enter.






                   L.   Each Tenant must provide Building Management an approved “access list” of personnel allowed to access the
                        Datacenter. Access will be denied if an individual is not on the Tenant provided list.
                   M. Non-Emergency access to the Datacenter by a vendor representing a Tenant must be arranged at least 12 hours in
                      advance, and must be provided in writing to Building Management. All requests must describe in detail the planned
                      scope of work. See SAMPLE VENDOR AUTHORIZATION REQUEST EMAIL at the end of this document.
                   N.   Emergency access after hours requires a phone call to the Building Security by the Tenant, with a complete
                        description of the scope of work and the nature of the emergency. Some work scope may require the approval of the
                        on-call Building Engineer prior to granting access to the vendor.

                                                                         EXHIBIT “I”

                                                           LETTER OF CREDIT PROVISIONS

                   A. General. As additional consideration for Landlord’s agreement to enter into this Lease, within five (5) days following
              Tenant’s execution and delivery of this Lease, and as a condition to Landlord’s obligations under the Lease, Tenant covenants
              and agrees to deliver to Landlord, as additional consideration, an irrevocable letter of credit (the “L/C”) in the form of, and
              upon all of the terms and conditions contained in, this Exhibit “I” and Appendix “I”, attached hereto. The L/C shall be issued
              by an institutional lender of good financial standing (which lender shall, in any event, have assets equal to or exceeding
              $500,000,000 as of the date of issuance of the L/C), having a place of business where the L/C can be presented for payment in
              Phoenix, Arizona. The lender shall be subject to Landlord’s prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
              withheld, conditioned or delayed. The L/C shall provide for one (1) or more draws by Landlord or its transferee up to the
              aggregate amount of US $81,131.00 (the “L/C Amount”) on the terms and conditions of this Exhibit “I”. Landlord and Tenant
              acknowledge and agree that in no event or circumstance shall the L/C or any renewal thereof or substitute therefor or any
              proceeds thereof be deemed to be or treated as a “security deposit” under any Applicable Security Deposit Laws.

                    B. Renewal of L/C. Tenant shall maintain the L/C in effect from the date which Tenant delivers the L/C to Landlord until
              the date which is sixty (60) days after Tenant shall have performed all of its obligations under the Lease (said period is
              hereinafter referred to as the “L/C Term”). If the expiration date of the L/C (or any renewal or replacement L/C provided
              pursuant to this section) occurs prior to the end of the L/C Term, then Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a renewal of the L/C or a
              replacement L/C meeting all of the terms and conditions of this section, not later than sixty (60) days prior to the then-
              applicable expiration date. Each L/C provided pursuant to this section shall have an expiration date which is at least one
              (1) year from such L/C’s date of issue except where the then-applicable expiration date of the L/C is less than one (1) year from
              the end of the L/C Term, in which case the renewal or replacement L/C shall be for such lesser period. The issuing bank’s
              agreement to place an automatic renewal provision in the L/C, as required pursuant to said Appendix “I”, shall not relieve or
              release Tenant from its obligation to provide a renewal or replacement L/C on the terms hereinabove stated, it being understood
              that any such automatic renewal is an independent obligation of the issuing bank which is intended for Landlord’s sole benefit.
              If Tenant fails to provide the renewal or replacement L/C not later than sixty (60) days prior to the then-applicable, stated
              expiration date (excluding automatic renewal provisions), such failure shall be a default by Tenant, and Landlord shall have the
              right, without notice or demand, on one or more occasions, to draw upon all or any part of the remaining proceeds of the L/C.

                    C. Draw on L/C. Landlord may elect from time to time, in Landlord’s sole discretion, without notice or demand to Tenant,
              to draw upon all or any part of the remaining proceeds of the L/C upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
              (i) Tenant fails to perform any of its obligations under the Lease (including, but not limited to, its obligations under this
              section), whether or not such failure constitutes a default by Tenant as defined in the Lease; or (ii) Tenant makes any
              assignment for the benefit of creditors, Tenant declares bankruptcy or is the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, a
              trustee or receiver is appointed to take possession of some or all of Tenant’s assets or, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment,
              Tenant is insolvent.

                   D. Application of L/C Proceeds Landlord may elect, from time to time, upon written notice to Tenant, in Landlord’s sole
              discretion, to apply the proceeds it receives from a draw on the L/C in one or more of the following manners without prejudice
              to any other remedies: (i) as payment for some or all of the rent or other amounts owed by Tenant under the Lease but unpaid
              on the date of such draw, (ii) as payment for some or all of the future amounts of rent or other amounts that Landlord estimates
              will be due and payable under the Lease after the date of the draw, (iii) as payment for some or all of the damage Landlord may
              suffer as a result of Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under the Lease, (iv) as collateral for obligations of Tenant under
              the Lease, and/or (v) in any other manner permitted by the Lease or applicable law. Landlord may make one or more partial
              draws under the L/C and shall have the right, upon written notice to Tenant, to treat each draw or a portion thereof in one or
              more of the ways described






              in the previous sentence. Tenant hereby waives any other law or regulation that may be inconsistent with the terms and
              conditions of this section.

                    E. Enforcement. Tenant’s obligation to furnish the L/C shall not be released, modified or affected by any failure or delay
              on the part of Landlord to enforce or assert any of its rights or remedies under the Lease or this section, whether pursuant to the
              terms thereof or at law or in equity. Landlord’s right to draw upon the L/C shall be without prejudice or limitation to Landlord’s
              right to draw upon any security deposit provided by Tenant to Landlord or to avail itself of any other rights or remedies
              available to Landlord under the Lease, as amended hereby, or at law or equity.

                   F. Event of Default. Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Exhibit “I” (time being of the essence) shall
              constitute an Event of Default under the Lease and shall entitle Landlord to immediately exercise all of its rights and remedies
              under the Lease (including, but not limited to rights and remedies under this Exhibit “I”) or at law or in equity without notice
              or demand to Tenant.

                   G. Conflict. If there is any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Exhibit “I” and the terms and conditions of
              the Lease, as amended by this Amendment, the terms of this Exhibit “I” shall control.
