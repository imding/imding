              9. CASUALTY; EMINENT DOMAIN; INSURANCE.
                   9.1 Casualty; Eminent Domain.
                        9.1.1 If at any time during the Term of this Lease, a material portion of the Property, the Building or the
              Premises shall be (i) damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty (a “Casualty”) or (ii) taken under the power of
              eminent domain or condemned by any competent authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, or sold to
              prevent the exercise thereof (a “Taking”), then Landlord shall have the right to elect, in Landlord’s sole and absolute
              discretion, to either (a) terminate this Lease by delivery of written notice (a “Termination Notice”) thereof to
              Tenant or (b) to continue this Lease, in which case, Landlord shall repair and reconstruct the Tenant Space to
              substantially the same condition in which they existed immediately prior to such Casualty or Taking (except for the
              Premises, which must only be restored to its Commencement Date (i.e., “shell”) condition). If as a result of the
              Casualty or Taking, the Tenant Space is unfit for use by Tenant in the ordinary conduct of Tenant’s business and
              actually is not used by Tenant, then Landlord shall provide written notice (the “Restoration Notice”) to Tenant as
              soon as practicable after the Casualty or Taking of the period of time (the “Stated Restoration Period”) which shall
              be required for the repair and restoration of the Building to permit use of the Tenant Space in the ordinary conduct of
              Tenant’s business and Tenant shall have the right, at its election, to terminate this Lease if either (i) the Stated
              Restoration Period shall be in excess of ninety (90) days following the Casualty
                                                               Data Center Lease




                                                                           -15-




                                                                                                                                 Page

              or Taking and Tenant terminates this Lease with written notice thereof to Landlord within thirty (30) days following
              delivery of the Restoration Notice, or (ii) Landlord shall fail within the Stated Restoration Period to complete the
              repair and restoration of the Building necessary to allow Tenant’s use of the Tenant Space in the ordinary conduct of
              Tenant’s business and Tenant delivers written notice of such termination to Landlord within thirty (30) business days
              following the expiration of the restoration deadline.

                        9.1.2 Base Rent Abatement In the event that this Lease is terminated as herein permitted, all Rent abates
              as of the date of such Casualty and Landlord shall refund to Tenant any prepaid Base Rent less any sum then owing
              Landlord by Tenant. Landlord shall not be obligated to carry insurance on Tenant’s personal property within the
              Tenant Space. If the Lease shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 9.1.1, above, Base Rent shall
              abate proportionately during the period and to the extent that the Tenant Space is unfit for use by Tenant in the
              ordinary conduct of Tenant’s business and actually is not used by Tenant, this Lease shall continue in full force and
              effect, and such repairs shall be made within a reasonable time thereafter, subject to Force Majeure, including,
              without limitation, delays arising from shortages of labor or material, delay in obtaining government approvals or
              other conditions beyond Landlord’s reasonable control.

                        9.1.3 Tenant’s Remedy. Tenant’s termination right and Base Rent abatement, to the extent provided above
              in this Article 9, shall be Tenant’s sole remedies in the event of a Casualty or Taking, and Tenant shall not be entitled
              to any compensation or damages for loss of, or interference with, Tenant’s business or use or access of all or any part
              of the Tenant Space resulting from any such damage, repair, reconstruction or restoration; provided, however, that
              notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any Casualty is caused by any negligent act or omission or willful
              misconduct of Tenant or any Tenant Party, Tenant shall not be entitled to terminate this Lease under Section 9.1.1
              and, once and if Tenant’s Rental Loss Insurance is exhausted, there shall be no abatement of any Base Rent (or any
              other Rent or other amounts) due hereunder.

                        9.1.4 Waiver. Landlord and Tenant agree that the provisions of this Article 9 and the remaining provisions
              of this Lease shall exclusively govern the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to any and all damage to,
              or destruction of, all or any portion of the Tenant Space, the Building or the Property, and/or any Taking thereof, and
              each Landlord and Tenant hereby waive and release each and all of their respective common law and statutory rights
              inconsistent herewith, whether now or hereinafter in effect.

                         9.1.5 Subrogation. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, whenever (a) any loss,
              cost, damage or expense resulting from damage to or destruction of tangible property attributable to fire, explosion
              or any other casualty or occurrence is incurred by either of the parties to this Lease in connection with the Tenant
              Space or the Building, and (b) such party is then covered in whole or in part by insurance with respect to such loss,
              cost, damage or expense or would be covered in whole or in part by insurance required to be carried under the terms
              of this Lease, then such party hereby releases the other party from any liability it may have on account of such loss,
              cost, damage or expense to the extent of any amount recovered by reason of such insurance, or which would have
              been recovered under the insurance required to be carried under the terms of this Lease, and waives any right of
              subrogation which might otherwise exist in or accrue to any person or account thereof, provided that such release of
              liability and waiver of the right of subrogation shall not be operative in any case where the effect thereof is to
              invalidate such insurance coverage.

                   9.2 Tenant’s Insurance. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense, procure and maintain throughout the Term of this
              Lease a policy or policies of insurance in accordance with the terms and requirements set forth in Exhibit “B” to
              this Lease. Tenant hereby waives its rights against the Landlord Group (defined in Item 24 of the Basic Lease
              Information) with respect to any claims or damages or losses (including any claims for bodily injury to persons
              and/or damage to property) which are caused by or result from (i) risks insured

                                                                           -16-





                                                                                                                                  Page

              against under any insurance policy carried by Tenant at the time of such claim, damage, loss or injury, or (ii) risks
              which would have been covered under any insurance required to be obtained and maintained by Tenant under this
              Lease had such insurance been obtained and maintained as required. The foregoing waivers shall be in addition to,
              and not a limitation of, any other waivers or releases contained in this Lease.

                   9.3 Landlord’s Insurance. Landlord shall, at Landlord’s expense, procure and maintain throughout the Term of
              this Lease (a) a policy or policies of insurance insuring the Building and the Property and all of Landlord’s
              equipment and fixtures installed therein against loss due to fire and other casualties included in standard extended
              coverage insurance policies, in an amount equal to the replacement cost thereof with a commercially reasonable
              deductible; and (b) a commercially reasonable amount of commercial general liability insurance with a
              commercially reasonable deductible. Landlord shall also maintain such insurance as is customarily carried by
              reasonably prudent landlords of data centers in the Piscataway, New Jersey market area.
