                               8.1       Operating Expenses. For clarification purposes, Tenant’s Proportionate Share

                                         calendar year during the Term, as provided in Section 9 below. It is intended that
                                         this Lease be a "triple net lease," and that the Rent to be paid hereunder by

                                         by Tenant, foreseeable or unforeseeable, except as expressly set forth in this

                                         or hereafter be placed upon the Premises by an affirmative act or omission of
