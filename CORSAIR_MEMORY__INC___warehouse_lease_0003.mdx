4.   RENT
                   (a) Base Rent. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, in advance on the first day of each month, without further notice
              or demand and without abatement, offset, rebate, credit or deduction for any reason whatsoever, the monthly
              installments of rent specified in the Basic Lease Information (the “Base Rent”).

                 Upon execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Security Deposit, Prepaid Rent and the first
              monthly installment of estimated Additional Rent (as hereinafter defined)

 


              specified in the Basic Lease Information to be applied toward Base Rent and Additional Rent for the month(s) of the
              Term specified in the Basic Lease Information.

                   As used in this Lease, the term “Additional Rent” shall mean all sums of money, other than Base Rent, that
              shall become due from and payable by Tenant pursuant to this Lease.

                   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant’s obligation to pay Base Rent for the first four (4) months of the Term
              shall be waived, provided that and only so long as Tenant fully performs all of its monetary obligations under this
              Lease. Tenant understands and agrees that, if any time during the Term, Tenant fails to cure any monetary default
              within the time period set forth in Paragraph 24 below, Landlord’s agreement to waive payment of Base Rent shall
              be immediately revoked without further notice to Tenant, and any previous waiver of Base Rent shall be null and
              void. In any notice given by Landlord pursuant to Paragraph 24 of this Lease, Landlord shall have the right to
              demand any and all Base Rent that would have been due and payable in accordance with this Lease absent the
              waiver contained herein. Landlord’s waiver of Tenant’s obligation to pay Base Rent during the first four (4) months
              of the Term shall not be construed as Landlord’s waiver of Tenant’s obligation to pay Additional Rent during such
              four month period (including, without limitation, Operating Expenses, Insurance Expenses, Utility Expenses, and
              Taxes).

                   (b) Additional Rent.

                       (1) This Lease is intended to be a triple-net lease with respect to Landlord and subject to the provisions of
              Paragraph 13(b) of this Lease, the Base Rent owing hereunder is (x) to be paid by Tenant absolutely net of all costs
              and expenses relating to Landlord’s ownership and operation of the Project and the Building, and (y) not to be
              reduced, offset or diminished, directly or indirectly, by any cost, charge or expense payable hereunder by Tenant or
              by others in connection with the Premises, the Building and/or the Project, or any part thereof. The provisions of this
              Paragraph 4(b) are intended to pass on to Tenant, Tenant’s share of all costs and expenses relating to Landlord’s
              ownership and operation of the Premises, the Building and/or the Project. During the Term, in addition to the Base
              Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, in accordance with this Paragraph 4, (i) Tenant’s
              Proportionate Share(s) of Operating Expenses (as defined below) attributable to each Computation Year (as defined
              below), (ii) Tenant’s Proportionate Share(s) of Insurance Expenses (as defined below) attributable to each
              Computation Year, (iii) Tenant’s Proportionate Share(s) of Utility Expenses (as defined below) attributable to each
              Computation Year, and (iv) Tenant’s Proportionate Share(s) of Taxes (as defined below) attributable to each
              Computation Year.

              connection with the Building, the Premises and/or the Project (A) which are intended to effect economies in the

              of structural or nonstructural items located in the Common Areas required to keep the Common Areas in good order
              or condition, (D) that are required under any governmental law or regulation, excluding capital improvements to
              correct a condition existing on the date of this Lease, which an applicable governmental authority, if it had
              knowledge of such condition, would have required to be corrected pursuant to its then-current interpretation of such
              laws or regulations, (E) that Landlord determines, in its reasonable discretion, are necessary to enhance Building
              security and improve security measures at the Project, or (F) that are capitalized by Landlord under generally
              accepted real estate accounting principles. The cost of capital improvements that are permitted to be included as
              Operating Expenses shall be amortized over the useful life thereof, as reasonably determined by Landlord, together
              with interest on the unamortized balance at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum or such higher interest rate
              as may have been paid by Landlord on funds borrowed for the purpose of constructing or acquiring such capital
              improvements, but in either case not more than the maximum rate permitted by law at the time such capital
              improvements are constructed or acquired. Upon request by Tenant, Landlord shall provide reasonable
              documentation of any such higher interest rate paid by Landlord.

                   Notwithstanding anything in this Paragraph 4(b) to the contrary, Insurance Expenses, Utility Expenses and
              Taxes shall not be deemed to constitute “Operating Expenses” for purposes of this Paragraph 4(b)(2)(A). In addition,
              Operating Expenses shall exclude the following: real estate commissions or brokerage fees incurred in connection
              with the negotiation and execution of leases for the Project; marketing and advertising expenses incurred in
              connection with the leasing of space in the Project; costs for which Landlord is reimbursed by insurance proceeds;

              tax or other tax or informational returns when due. In addition, Tenant shall receive the benefit of any credits,
              refunds or discounts realized by Landlord to the extent the full amount of such costs were previously included in
              Operating Expenses.

                            (B) “Insurance Expenses” means the total costs and expenses paid or incurred by Landlord in
              connection with the obtaining of insurance on the Premises, the Building

 

              and/or the Project or any part thereof or interest therein, including, without limitation, premiums for “all risk” fire
              and extended coverage insurance, commercial general liability insurance, rent loss or abatement insurance,
              earthquake insurance, flood or surface water, coverage, and other insurance as Landlord deems necessary in its sole
              discretion, and any deductibles paid under policies of any such insurance. The foregoing shall not be deemed an
              agreement by Landlord to carry any particular insurance relating to the Premises, Building, or Project.

                             (C) “Utility Expenses” means the cost of all Utilities, including, without limitation, any surcharges,
              conservation, bond and/or debt repayment surcharges, and charges of a onetime nature for serving the Premises, the
              Building and the Project or any part thereof that are not separately metered and billed to Tenant or any other tenant,
              and any amounts, taxes, charges, surcharges, assessments or impositions levied, assessed or imposed upon the
              Premises, the Building or the Project or any part thereof, or upon Tenant’s use and occupancy thereof, as a result of
              any rationing of Utility services or restriction on Utility use affecting the Premises, the Building and/or the Project,
              as contemplated in Paragraph 5 below.

                               (D) “Taxes” means all real estate taxes and assessments, which shall include any form of tax,
              assessment (including any special or general assessments and any assessments or charges for Utilities or similar
              purposes included within any tax bill for the Building or the Project or any part thereof, including, without
              limitation, entitlement fees (excluding any such fees related to the initial development or construction of the
              Building or the Project), allocation unit fees and/or any similar fees or charges), fee, license fee, business license
              fee, levy, penalty (if a result of Tenant’s delinquency), sales tax, rent tax, occupancy tax or other tax (other than net
              income, estate, succession, inheritance, transfer or franchise taxes), imposed by any authority having the direct or
              indirect power to tax, or by any city, county, state or federal government or any improvement or other district or
              division thereof, whether such tax is determined by the area of the Premises, the Building and/or the Project or any
              part thereof, or the Rent and other sums payable hereunder by Tenant or by other tenants, including, but not limited
              to, (i) any gross income or excise tax levied by any of the foregoing authorities, with respect to receipt of Rent
              and/or other sums due under this Lease; (ii) upon any legal or equitable interest of Landlord in the Premises, the
              Building and/or the Project or any part thereof, (iii) upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party
              creating or transferring any interest in the Premises, the Building and/or the Project; (iv) levied or assessed in lieu
              of, in substitution for, or in addition to, existing or additional taxes against the Premises, the Building and/or the
              Project, whether or not now customary or within the contemplation of the parties; or surcharged against the Parking
              Area. “Taxes” shall also include legal and consultants’ fees, costs and disbursements incurred in connection with
              proceedings to contest, determine or reduce taxes, Landlord specifically reserving the right, but not the obligation, to
              contest by appropriate legal proceedings the amount or validity of any taxes. Tenant and Landlord acknowledge that
              Proposition 13 was adopted by the voters of the State of California in the June, 1978 election and that assessments,
              taxes, fees, levies and charges may be imposed by governmental agencies for such purposes as fire protection, street,
              sidewalk, road, utility construction and maintenance, refuse removal and for other governmental services which may
              formerly have been provided without charge to property owners or occupants. It is the intention of the parties that all
              new and increased assessments, taxes, fees, levies and charges due to any cause whatsoever are to be included
              within the definition of real property taxes for purposes of this Lease.

 

                             (E) “Computation Year” shall mean each twelve (12) consecutive month period commencing
              January 1 of each year during the Term, provided that Landlord, upon notice to Tenant, may change the
              Computation Year from time to time to any other twelve (12) consecutive month period, and, in the event of any
              such change, Tenant’s Proportionate Share(s) of Operating Expenses, Insurance Expenses, Utility Expenses and
              Taxes shall be equitably adjusted for the Computation Years involved in any such change.

                   (c) Payment of Additional Rent.

                        (1) Upon commencement of this Lease, Landlord shall submit to Tenant an estimate of monthly Additional
              Rent for the period between the Commencement Date and the following December 31 and Tenant shall pay such
              estimated Additional Rent on a monthly basis, in advance, on the first day of each month. Tenant shall continue to
              make said monthly payments until notified by Landlord of a change therein. Thereafter, within ninety (90) days of
              the end of each Computation Year or as soon thereafter as practicable, Landlord shall give to Tenant Notice of
              Landlord’s estimate of the total amounts that will be payable by Tenant under Paragraph 4(b) for the following
              Computation Year. If at any time or times Landlord determines that the amounts payable under Paragraph 4(b) for
              the current Computation Year will vary from Landlord’s estimate given to Tenant, Landlord, by notice to Tenant,
              may revise the estimate for such Computation Year, and subsequent payments by Tenant for such Computation Year
              shall be based upon such revised estimate. By April 1 of each Computation Year, Landlord shall endeavor to provide
              to Tenant a statement showing the actual Additional Rent due to Landlord for the prior Computation Year, to be
              prorated for partial Computation Years during the Term. If the total of the monthly payments of Additional Rent that
              Tenant has made for the prior Computation Year is less than the actual Additional Rent chargeable to Tenant for such
              prior Computation Year, then Tenant shall pay the difference in a lump sum within ten (10) days after receipt of such
              statement from Landlord. Any overpayment by Tenant of Additional Rent for the prior Computation Year shall, at
              Landlord’s option, be credited towards the Additional Rent next due or returned to Tenant in a lump sum payment
              within ten (10) days after delivery of such statement.

                        (2) Landlord’s then-current annual operating and capital budgets for the Building and the Project or the
              pertinent part thereof shall be used for purposes of calculating Tenant’s monthly payment of estimated Additional
              Rent for the current year, subject to adjustment as provided above. Landlord shall make the final determination of
              Additional Rent for the year in which this Lease terminates as soon as possible after termination of such year. Even
              though the Term has expired and Tenant has vacated the Premises, with respect to the year in which this Lease
              expires or terminates, Tenant shall remain liable for payment of any amount due to Landlord in excess of the
              estimated Additional Rent previously paid by Tenant, and, conversely, Landlord shall promptly return to Tenant any
              overpayment. Failure of Landlord to submit statements as called for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of Tenant’s
              obligation to pay Additional Rent as herein provided.

                        (3) With respect to Operating Expenses, Insurance Expenses, Utility Expenses or Taxes which Landlord
              allocates to the Building, Tenant’s “Proportionate Share” shall be the percentage set forth in the Basic Lease
              Information as Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the Building. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may
              equitably adjust Tenant’s Proportionate


              Share(s) for all or part of any item of expense or cost reimbursable by Tenant that relates to a repair, replacement, or
              service that benefits only the Premises or only a portion of the Building and/or the Project or that varies with the
              occupancy of the Building and/or the Project. Further, Operating Expenses, Insurance Expenses, Utility Expenses
              and/or Taxes paid or incurred in connection with the Project as a whole or multiple buildings in the Project shall be
              reasonably and equitably allocated by Landlord among the applicable buildings, and Tenant shall pay one hundred
              percent (100%) of the portion of such Operating Expenses, Insurance Expenses, Utility Expenses and/or Taxes
              reasonably and equitably allocated to the Building.

                        (4) In the event the average occupancy level of the Building or the Project for any Computation Year is not
              ninety-five percent (95%) or more of full occupancy, then the Operating Expenses for such year shall be apportioned
              among the tenants by the Landlord to reflect those costs which would have occurred had the Building or the Project,
              as applicable, been ninety-five percent (95%) occupied during such year.

                        (5) Intentionally Deleted.

                  (d) General Payment Terms. The Base Rent, Additional Rent and all other sums payable by Tenant to
              Landlord hereunder, any late charges assessed pursuant to Paragraph 6 below and any interest assessed pursuant to
              Paragraph 46 below, are referred to as “Rent.” All Rent shall be paid without deduction, offset or abatement in
              lawful money of the United States of America and through a domestic branch of a United States financial institution.
              Checks are to be made payable to “Sutter Hill Investors LLC” and shall be mailed to: Woodmont Real Estate
              Services, Inc., 1050 Ralston Avenue, Belmont, California 94002 or to such other person or place as Landlord may,
              from time to time, designate to Tenant in writing. The Rent for any fractional part of a calendar month at the
              commencement or termination of the Term shall be a prorated amount of the Rent for a full calendar month based
              upon a thirty (30) day month.

                   (e) Statements Binding. Every statement given by Landlord pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Paragraph 4 shall
              be conclusive and binding upon Tenant unless within ninety (90) days after the receipt of such statement Tenant
              shall notify Landlord (a “Dispute Notice”) that it disputes the correctness thereof, specifying, subject to Tenant’s
              audit rights set forth in paragraph (f) below, the particular respects in which the statement is claimed to be incorrect.
              Following Landlord’s receipt of a Dispute Notice, Landlord and Tenant shall have a period of forty-five (45) days in
              which to discuss the matters raised in such Dispute Notice and reach agreement on a resolution thereof. If Landlord
              and Tenant are not able to resolve such dispute within such forty-five (45) day period, then Tenant shall submit the
              dispute to arbitration within forty-five (45) days after the end of such forty-five (45) day discussion period. Pending
              the determination of such dispute by agreement or arbitration as aforesaid, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after
              receipt of such statement, pay Additional Rent in accordance with Landlord’s statement and such payment shall be
              without prejudice to Tenant’s position. If the dispute shall be determined in Tenant’s favor, Landlord shall within
              thirty (30) days pay Tenant the amount of Tenant’s overpayment of Additional Rent resulting from compliance with
              Landlord’s statement.

                  (f) Audit Rights. Provided Tenant notifies Landlord in accordance with the terms of paragraph (e) above that
              Tenant disputes a statement received from Landlord, Tenant or its CPA (as defined below) shall have the right, at
              Tenant’s sole cost and expense, provided Tenant


              utilizes a Certified Public Accountant (the “CPA”) compensated solely on an hourly basis, upon at least thirty
              (30) days prior notice to Landlord at any time during regular business hours to audit, review and photocopy
              Landlord’s records pertaining to Operating Expenses for the immediately previous calendar year only. Tenant shall
              complete the audit and present any disputed charges to Landlord, in writing, within six months of receipt of
              Landlord’s statement pursuant to Paragraph (c) of this Paragraph 4. If, following Landlord’s receipt of the audit and
              any disputed charges (the “Report Date”), Landlord disputes the findings contained therein, and Landlord and
              Tenant are not able to resolve their differences within thirty (30) days following the Report Date, the dispute shall be
              resolved by binding arbitration as follows: Landlord and Tenant shall each designate an independent certified public
              accountant, which shall in turn jointly select a third independent Certified Public Accountant (the “Third CPA”).
              The Third CPA, within thirty (30) days of selection, shall, at Tenant’s sole expense, audit the relevant records and
              certify the proper amount within. That certification shall be final and conclusive. If the Third CPA determines that
              the amount of Operating Expenses billed to Tenant was incorrect, the appropriate party shall pay to the other party
              the deficiency or overpayment, as applicable, within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Third Party CPA’s
              decision, without interest. Tenant agrees to keep all information thereby obtained by Tenant confidential and to
              obtain the agreement of its CPA and Third CPA to keep all such information confidential. Tenant shall provide a
              copy of such CPA agreements to Landlord promptly upon request.
