                                                         ARIZONA STATE LAW PROVISIONS

              1.   REMEDIES FOR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.
                  1.1 Landlord’s Right to Terminate Upon Tenant Default. This Lease and the Term and estate hereby granted and the
              demise hereby made are subject to the limitation that if and whenever any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
              Landlord may, at Landlord’s option, in addition to all other rights and remedies given hereunder or by law or equity, do any one
              or more of the following without notice or demand, any such notice or demand being hereby waived, to the extent that such
              waiver is allowed by Applicable Laws:
                              1.1.1 Terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Tenant Space
              to Landlord.

                              1.1.2 Enter upon and take possession of the Tenant Space and expel or remove Tenant and any other occupant
              therefrom, with or without having terminated the Lease.

                              1.1.3 Alter locks and other security devices at the Tenant Space.

                              1.1.4 Terminate any and all agreements, subleases, licenses, concessions or other consensual arrangements for
              possession entered into by Tenant, with Landlord or with third parties, and affecting the Tenant Space or any part of the Meet-
              Me Room or the Building.

                   1.2 No Surrender or Merger. Exercise by Landlord of any one or more remedies hereunder granted or otherwise
              available shall not be deemed to be an acceptance of surrender of all or any part of the Tenant Space by Tenant, whether by
              agreement or by operation of law, it being understood that such surrender can be effected only by the written agreement of
              Landlord and Tenant. No such alteration of security devices and no removal or other exercise of dominion by Landlord over the
              property of Tenant or others on or about the Tenant Space shall be deemed unauthorized or constitute a conversion, Tenant
              hereby consenting, after any Event of Default, to the aforesaid exercise of dominion over Tenant’s property within the Building.
              All claims for damages by reason of such re-entry and/or possession and/or alteration of locks or other security devices are
              hereby waived, as are all claims for damages by reason of any distress warrant, forcible detainer proceedings, sequestration
              proceedings or other legal process, to the extent that such waiver is allowed by Applicable Laws. Tenant agrees that any re-
              entry by Landlord may be pursuant to judgment obtained in forcible detainer proceedings or other legal proceedings or without
              the necessity for any legal proceedings, as Landlord may elect, and Landlord shall not be liable in trespass or otherwise.
              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied in the foregoing, Landlord agrees, in the exercise of its remedies
              under this Exhibit “D”, to use commercially reasonable efforts in the physical handling and/or moving of Tenant’s property,
              and to be and remain responsible for the gross negligence and willful misconduct of Landlord and of Landlord’s agents,
              employees and contractors in connection therewith.

                   1.3 Damages Upon Default. If Landlord elects not to terminate this Lease by reason of an Event of Default, then,
              notwithstanding such termination, Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay to Landlord the sum of all rental and other
              indebtedness accrued to the date of such termination, plus, as damages, an amount equal to the then present value of the rental
              reserved hereunder (including, without limitation, Rent and all other charges under this Lease) for the remaining portion of the
              Term of this Lease (had such Term not been terminated by Landlord prior to the expiration of the Term of this Lease), less the
              then present value of the fair rental value of the Tenant Space for such period.

                         In the event that Landlord elects to terminate the Lease by reason of any Event of Default, in lieu of exercising the
              rights of Landlord under the preceding paragraph of this Section 1.3, Landlord may instead hold Tenant liable for all rental and
              other indebtedness accrued to the date of such

              termination, plus such rental and other indebtedness as would otherwise have been required to be paid by Tenant to Landlord
              during the period following termination of the Term of this Lease measured from the date of such termination by Landlord until
              the expiration of the Term of this Lease (had Landlord not elected to terminate the Lease on account of such Event of Default),
              subject to Landlord’s duty to mitigate its damages, as set forth in Section 1.9 of this Exhibit “D”. Actions to collect amounts
              due by Tenant provided for in this paragraph of this Section 1.4 may be brought from time to time by Landlord during the
              aforesaid period, on one or more occasions, without the necessity of Landlord’s waiting until the expiration of such period, and
              in no event shall Tenant be entitled to any excess of rental (or rental plus other sums) obtained by reletting over and above the
              rental provided for in this Lease. If Landlord accelerates future payments under this Lease following an Event of Default, all
              rents and other amounts owing to Landlord shall be discounted to their present value using a discount factor of six percent
              (6%).

                   1.4 Repossession of Tenant Space. If Landlord elects to repossess the Tenant Space without terminating this Lease,
              Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay to Landlord all rental and other indebtedness accrued to the date of such repossession,
              plus Rent required to be paid by Tenant to Landlord during the remainder of the Term of this Lease until the expiration of the
              Term of this Lease, subject to Landlord’s duty to mitigate its damages, as set forth in Section 1.9 of this Exhibit “D”. In no
              event shall Tenant be entitled to any excess of any rental obtained by reletting over and above the rental herein reserved.
              Actions to collect amounts due by Tenant as provided in this Section 1.4 may be brought from time to time, on one or more
              occasions, without the necessity of Landlord’s waiting until the expiration of the Term of this Lease.

                     1.5 Landlord’s Expenses. Upon an Event of Default, Tenant shall also be liable for and shall pay to Landlord, in addition
              to any sum provided to be paid pursuant to this Lease: (i) the reasonable costs and expenses of securing new tenants, including
              expenses for refixturing, alterations and other costs in connection with preparing the Tenant Space for the new tenant and any
              reasonable or necessary alterations, (ii) the reasonable cost of removing and storing Tenant’s or other occupant’s property, and
              (iii) all reasonable expenses incurred by Landlord in enforcing Landlord’s remedies, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Past
              due rental and other past due payments shall bear interest from maturity at the Default Rate (as defined in Section 3.4 of the
              Lease) until paid.

                    1.6 Cumulative Remedies; Equitable Relief. The specific remedies to which Landlord may resort under the provisions
              of this Lease are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other remedies or means of redress to which it may be
              lawfully entitled in case of any breach or threatened breach by Tenant of any provisions of this Lease. In addition to the other
              remedies provided in this Lease, subject to Applicable Laws, Landlord shall be entitled to a restraint by injunction of the
              violation or attempted or threatened violation of any of the covenants, conditions or provisions of this Lease or to a decree
              compelling specific performance of any such covenants, conditions or provisions.

                    1.7 Reletting. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has entered into this Lease in reliance upon, among other matters,
              Tenant’s agreement and continuing obligation to pay all rental due throughout the Term. As a result, Tenant hereby knowingly
              and voluntarily waives, after advice of competent counsel, any duty of Landlord (and any affirmative defense based upon such
              duty) following any default to relet the Tenant Space or otherwise mitigate Landlord’s damages arising from such default,
              except as set forth in Section 1.9, below. In connection with the foregoing, and consistent with Landlord’s duty to use
              commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages as set forth in Section 1.9, below, Tenant agrees that Landlord has no
              obligation to: (i) relet the Tenant Space prior to leasing any other space within the Building; or (ii) relet the Tenant Space (A) at
              a rental rate or otherwise on terms below market, as then determined by Landlord in its sole discretion; (B) to any entity not
              satisfying Landlord’s then standard financial credit risk criteria; (C) for a use (1) not consistent with Tenant’s use prior to
              default; (2) which would violate then applicable law or any restrictive covenant or other lease affecting the Building; (3) which
              would impose a greater burden upon the Building’s facilities; or (4) which would involve any use of Hazardous Materials; or
              (iii) make any alterations to the Tenant Space, the Datacenter or the Building or otherwise incur any costs in connection with
              any such reletting, unless Tenant unconditionally delivers to Landlord, in good and sufficient funds, the full amount thereof in
              advance.


                   1.8 Landlord’s Right to Cure. All covenants and agreements to be performed by Tenant under this Lease shall be
              performed by Tenant at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. If Tenant should fail to make any payment (other than Base Rent) or
              cure any default hereunder within the time herein permitted, Landlord, without being under any obligation to do so, without
              thereby waiving such default and in addition to and without prejudice to any other right or remedy of Landlord, may make such
              payment and/or remedy such other default for the account of Tenant (and enter the Tenant Space for such purpose), and
              thereupon Tenant shall be obligated to, and hereby agrees to, pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, within thirty (30) days
              following Landlord’s demand therefor, all reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
              incurred by Landlord in taking such remedial action, plus an administrative fee of ten percent (10%) of such amount.

                   1.9 Landlord’s Duty to Mitigate Damages. Notwithstanding anything in this Exhibit “D” to the contrary, Landlord
              agrees that, in the event of an Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
              Landlord’s damages.


                                                                        EXHIBIT “E”

                                                             LANDLORD’S INSTALLATIONS

              Landlord will cause:
              1.   one (1) Datacenter cage with one (1) lockable sliding gate to be installed, approximately as set forth on Exhibit “A”.
              2.   raised access flooring to be cut and installed in the Premises to accommodate power and network for Tenant’s cabinet,
                   equipment and relay rack layout.*
                   *    Tenant shall coordinate with Landlord’s Technical Operations team for criteria for sealing tile cuts.
              3.   an under floor grounding feed to be delivered to the Premises**.
                   **   Tenant is responsible for individual H-taps and grounding to cabinets, equipment and relay racks, including the cost
                        thereof.
              4.   submeter(s) to monitor power consumption to be installed.
              5.   installation of a raised floor for the Premises with a point load of 1,250 lbs.


                                                                       EXHIBIT “E-1”

                                                              COMMISSIONING CRITERIA

              Infrastructure commissioning consists of five general levels of activities summarized as follows, the specifics of which shall be
              mutually agreed upon by Landlord and Tenant.

              Level 1 – Factory Testing
              Manufacturers standard test reports will be reviewed prior to shipment of equipment to the site.

              Level 2 – Component Verification
              Individual system components are verified at the site upon delivery for compliance to the design specifications, drawings, and
              approved submittals or shop drawings.

              Level 3 – System Construction Verification
              As the components are assembled into individual systems, the construction or installation of the overall system is verified. This
              includes an evaluation on interconnection between components, physical arrangement, support and anchoring, and access and
              clearance.

              Level 4 – Individual System and Major Equipment Operation Verification
              Subsequent to the completion of construction and assembly of each individual system or major equipment element, it is started-
              up and tested for proper functional operation and performance.

              Level 5 – Integrated Systems Operation Verification
              The test procedures that comprise Level 5 commissioning are designed to simulate the operation of the Premises during a full
              range of operational situations, including loss of utility services, single and multiple equipment failure, normal sequential
              changes to the equipment operation, and planned maintenance operations. Tenant shall have the right to review the test
              procedures in advance to confirm that such test procedures are in accordance with generally accepted practices.

              This effort is dependent upon the successful completion of all prior levels of commissioning. The assembly of appropriate
              documentation and certifications for the completion of Level Four commissioning will be a prerequisite.

              Level 5 commissioning will typically be completed in four basic steps:
                    •   Initial planning
                    •   Preparation of test procedures
                    •   Implementation of tests
                    •   Documentation of test results. Tenant shall have the right to review the test results to confirm that the test results are
                        in accordance with the objective requirements set forth in the test procedures.

              To the extent that is possible, training of operational staff will be enhanced by their witnessing of and participation in the actual
              Level 5 testing. Specific training exercises may be considered where appropriate and time allows.

                                                                               -1-
                                                                   EXHIBIT “E-2”

                                                       MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

                   This Memorandum of Understanding (this “MOU”) is entered into as of the latest date of execution shown on the
              signature page hereof (the “MOU Effective Date”), by and among DIGITAL PHOENIX VAN BUREN, LLC (“Landlord”), as
              landlord,                    (“Tenant”), as tenant, and each of the contractors (collectively, the “Contractors”) listed on the
              signature pages hereof.

                  Reference is hereby made to that certain Turn Key Datacenter Lease (the “Lease”) dated               , 2007, by and
              between Landlord and Tenant, demising premises in that certain building commonly known as 120 E. Van Buren Street,
              Phoenix, Arizona (the “Building”). Unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized words and phrases shall have the same
              meanings as those given to them in the Lease.

                    Tenant desires to commence immediately with the performance of a number of fit-out and installation projects (as defined
              in the Lease, the “Tenant Work”) in the Premises in connection with the Lease.

                   Landlord agrees to permit Tenant to commence the Tenant Work on and after the date of this MOU, subject to Tenant’s,
              and the Contractors’, compliance with the terms of this MOU.

                   In addition to the requirements set forth in the Lease, Tenant acknowledges and agrees to the following:
                        1. Tenant agrees to comply with the Procedural Requirements (the “Procedural Requirements”) set forth on
                        Exhibit E-2-A, attached hereto.
                        2. Tenant will be responsible for causing Tenant’s employees, agents, contractors and vendors to coordinate schedules
                   with, take direction from, and comply with all site safety and work rules of, Landlord’s construction management team
                   (collectively, “Construction Manager”).
                        3. Tenant shall ensure that the Tenant Work will not delay Landlord’s completion of the Commencement Date
                   Conditions. Tenant hereby agrees that Tenant will, and will cause the Contractors to, work in harmony with Landlord and
                   Landlord’s contractors, who will be preparing the Commencement Date Conditions in the Premises during the Early
                   Access Period. Any Tenant Work that does delay Landlord’s performance of the Commencement Date Conditions shall be
                   referred to herein as a “Tenant Delay”. In the event that the Commencement Date is, in accordance with the terms of the
                   Lease, moved beyond the Target Commencement Date, due to Landlord not having delivered the Tenant Space to Tenant
                   on or before such date, the Commencement Date shall be deemed to have been moved up, day for day, by the number of
                   days of delay in Landlord’s completion of the Commencement Date Conditions caused by all such Tenant Delays (i.e., if
                   delivery of the Tenant Space (and, by definition, the Commencement Date) does not occur until November 20, 2007, but
                   there were 20 days of Tenant Delay, the Commencement Date would be deemed to have occurred on November 1, 2007).
                        4. While Landlord and Construction Manager will make reasonable efforts to facilitate the Tenant Work, it is
                   understood that it may be necessary, from time to time, to require interruption or cessation of all or part of the Tenant
                   Work in order to complete the Commencement Date Conditions. In the event continuation of the performance of the
                   Tenant Work will delay the performance of the Commencement Date Conditions and/or Landlord’s curing of any
                   deficiencies in the Commencement Date Conditions, Landlord may require Tenant’s Contractors and vendors to cease
                   performance of the Tenant Work until such time as performance of the Tenant Work will

                                                                             -1-


                   not delay the performance of the Commencement Date Conditions and/or Landlord’s curing of any deficiencies in the
                   Commencement Date Conditions.
                       5. Tenant will require each Contractor performing work on Tenant’s behalf to provide a certificate of insurance to the
                   Landlord, naming Landlord, Landlord’s property manager and Construction Manager as additional insureds, with
                   coverage as required by the Landlord (“Insurance Certificates”).
                        6. It is understood that there will be no permanent power or cooling in the Premises until the completion of the
                   Commencement Date Conditions, and that any temporary power provided during the construction project may need to be
                   interrupted without notice during the course of construction.
                       7. Any temporary power, cooling or other construction assistance (e.g., debris cart, equipment storage, labor, etc.)
                   which Tenant, or Tenant’s Contractors, may require in the course of the Tenant Work will be requested through
                   Construction Manager, via written change order signed by Tenant, and paid for by the Tenant or the Tenant’s Contractor.

                   Tenant acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord’s consent to Tenant’s performance of
              the Tenant Work is subject to and conditioned upon Tenant’s compliance with the terms of the Lease.
