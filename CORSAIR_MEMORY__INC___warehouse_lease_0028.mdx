                   4. Responsibility for Design and Construction Costs.

                        4.1 General. Tenant shall pay all costs for the design and construction of the Tenant Improvements.

                        4.2 Construction Administration Costs. Intentionally Deleted.

                    4.3 Utilities. Landlord shall pay for all electricity, gas and water furnished to the Premises prior to the
              Commencement Date.

                   5. Change Orders. Landlord will not unreasonably withhold its approval of (a) any request by Tenant, or by
              Tenant’s Contractor with Tenant’s approval, to amend or change the Approved Working Drawings, or (b) any change
              or amendment to the Approved Working Drawings that may be necessary to obtain any Permits, or which may be
              required by city officials or inspectors to comply with code rulings or interpretations (any of the foregoing, a
              “Change Order”), provided such Change Order does not diminish the quality of construction of the Tenant
              Improvements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, however, Tenant acknowledges that it shall not be
              unreasonable for Landlord to withhold consent to any Change Order if any of the circumstances listed in clauses (a)
              through (e) of Section 2.2 of this Work Letter applies. No material changes or modifications to the Approved
              Working Drawings shall be made unless by written Change Order signed by Landlord and Tenant. Tenant shall pay
              all costs attributable to Change Orders, including costs incurred by Landlord in reviewing proposed Change Orders.

                   6. Ownership of Tenant Improvements. The Tenant Improvements shall be deemed, effective upon installation,
              to be a part of the Premises and the Building and shall be deemed to be the property of Landlord (subject to Tenant’s
              right to use the same during the Tern of the Lease), and shall be surrendered at the expiration or earlier termination
              of the Term, unless Landlord shall have conditioned its approval of the Final Working Drawings or any Change
              Order on Tenant’s agreement to remove any items thereof, in which event, prior to the expiration or termination of
              the Term, the specified items shall be removed at Tenant’s expense, any damage caused by such removal shall be
              repaired, and the Premises shall be restored to their condition existing prior to the installation of the items in
              question, normal wear and tear excepted. The removal, repair and restoration described above shall, at Landlord’s
              sole election, be performed either by Tenant or by Landlord; and if such work shall be performed by Landlord,
              Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within twenty (20) days following Landlord’s demand, the reasonable cost and
              expense of such work.

                   7. Landlord’s Work; Condition of Roof and Systems.

                         7.1 Landlord, at Landlord’s expense, shall repair or replace (as reasonably determined by Landlord and
              Tenant) the existing tile floor in the main assembly area located in the north side of the Building, to the extent such
              tile floor is damaged as of the date of the Lease.

                       7.2 Landlord, at Landlord’s expense, shall repair existing roof leaks within sixty (60) days after the date of
              the Lease, subject to Force Majeure delays. Landlord represents, as of the Commencement Date, that the roof
              (including the roof membrane), ceiling tiles, and structural portions of the Building, the Parking Area, and the
              Systems serving the Premises are in

                                                                      Exhibit B–7





              good working condition and repair. If it is determined, within ninety (90) days following the Commencement Date,
              that the ceiling tiles, the Parking Area, or the Systems serving the Premises (other than the HVAC) were not in the
              required condition as of the Commencement Date, Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage
              resulting therefrom, but as Tenant’s sole remedy, Landlord, at no expense to Tenant, shall promptly cause the
              deficient portions of the Premises to be placed in the required condition. If it is determined, within the first twelve
              (12) months following the Commencement Date, that the roof of the Building, structural portions of the Building, or
              the HVAC serving the Premises were not in the required condition as of the Commencement Date, Landlord shall
              not be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, but as Tenant’s sole remedy, Landlord, at no
              expense to Tenant, shall promptly cause the roof (including any ceiling tiles damaged due to roof leaks), structural
              portions of the Building, and/or the HVAC to be placed in the required condition.

                       7.3 Landlord, at Landlord’s expense, shall place all existing doors not affected by construction of the
              Tenant Improvements on their hinges prior to commencement of construction of the Tenant Improvement Work.

                                                                      Exhibit B–8
