25. **OWNERSHIP.** Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, the term “Landlord” as used in this Lease, shall be defined as the then current owner(s) of the Total Property. In the event of any transfer of the Total Property, whereby this lease is assigned to the transferee incidental to such a transfer of the total property, the party the party conveying same shall thereafter be automatically released from all liability with respect to any obligations thereafter occurring or covenants thereafter to be performed by Landlord but only to the extent such obligations or covenants are properly assigned or otherwise conveyed. It is expressly understood and agreed that none of the covenants of Landlord under this Lease are personal in nature, and that Tenant agrees to look solely to the Total Property for recovery of any damages for breach or non-performance of any of the obligations of Landlord hereunder.

26. **SECURITY DEPOSIT.** Tenant has deposited with Landlord the sum of Six Thousand Eighty-Eight and 28/100 Dollars ($6,088.28) as security for the full and faithful performance of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease. Tenant acknowledges that such security deposit shall be placed in Landlord’s general operating account, with any interest accruing thereon payable to Landlord. Such security deposit shall not be construed as an advance Rent payment or as a measure of Landlord’s damages in the event of a Default by Tenant. If Tenant should be placed in default with respect to any provision of this Lease, Landlord may apply all or a portion of said security deposit for the payment of any sum in Default or for the payment of any amount which Landlord expends by reason of such Default. If any portion of said deposit is so applied, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord, within ten (10) days after receipt of Landlord’s written demand, an amount sufficient to restore said security deposit to its original amount. Upon the expiration of this Lease, Landlord shall return said security deposit to Tenant, provided Tenant has paid to Landlord all sums owing to Landlord under this Lease, and Tenant has returned the Premises to Landlord in compliance with the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 8 hereof. The security deposit and, as also required in Section 4, the first month’s rent are due and payable upon Lease execution by Tenant.

27. **ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES.** Each of Landlord and Tenant shall execute and return to the requesting party, within ten (10) business days, a statement in writing certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect, that the non-requesting party has no defenses, offsets or counterclaims against its obligations to pay any Rent or to perform any other covenants under this Lease, that there are no uncured Defaults of Landlord or Tenant, and setting forth the dates to which the Rent and other charges have been paid, and any other information reasonably requested by the requesting party. In the event the non-requesting party fails to return such statement within said ten (10) business days period setting forth the above or, alternatively, setting forth those lease modifications, defenses and/or uncured Defaults, the non-requesting party shall be in Default hereunder or, at the requesting party's election, it shall be deemed that the requesting party's statement is correct with respect to the information therein contained. Any such statement delivered pursuant to this Section may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser, mortgagee or assignee of any mortgagee of the Total Property.
