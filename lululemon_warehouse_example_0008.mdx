(b)	 	In making, erecting, installing or altering any Leasehold improvements or trade fixtures the Tenant will not alter or interfere with any installations which have been made by the Landlord without the prior written approval of the Landlord, and in no event shall alter or interfere with or affect the structural elements or the strength or outside appearance of the Building, or the mechanical, electrical, plumbing and climate control systems if any or the window coverings installed on exterior windows.

(c)	 	The Tenant’s request for any approval hereunder shall be in writing and accompanied by an adequate description of the contemplated work and, where appropriate, working drawings and specifications therefor. Any out-of-pocket expense incurred by the Landlord in connection with any such request for approval shall be deemed incurred by way of an Additional Service. All work to be performed in the Premises shall be performed by competent contractors and subcontractors of whom the Landlord shall have approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, but provided that the Landlord may require that the Landlord’s contractors and subcontractors be engaged for any mechanical or electrical work) and by workmen whose labor affiliations are compatible with those of workmen employed by the Landlord and its contractors and subcontractors. At the option of the Landlord, all such work shall be subject to inspection by and the reasonable supervision of the Landlord, as an Additional Service, and shall be performed in accordance with any reasonable conditions or regulations imposed by the Landlord (including without limitation the examination by the Landlord’s Architect or other experts of the detailed drawings and specifications as an Additional Service and contractor’s liability insurance in reasonable amounts) and completed in a good workmanlike manner in accordance with the description of the work approved by the Landlord.

 	The Tenant covenants that it will not sell, dispose of or remove any of the trade fixtures, goods or chattels of the Tenant from or out of the Premises during the Term without the consent of the Landlord, unless the Tenant is substituting new trade fixtures, goods or chattels of equal value or is bona fide disposing of individual items which have become excess for the Tenant’s purposes in the normal course of its business. The Tenant further covenants that it will at all times have and retain full legal and beneficial ownership of its trade fixtures, goods and chattels and will not permit them to be or become subject to any lien, mortgage, charge, encumbrance or title retention agreements except such as are bona fide incurred for the purpose of financing the purchase of such trade fixtures, goods or chattels.

Except to the extent herein or otherwise expressly agreed by the Landlord in writing, no Leasehold Improvements, trade fixtures, furniture or equipment shall be removed by the Tenant from the Premises either during or at the expiration or sooner termination of the Term, except that (a) the Tenant, if not in default hereunder, may at the end of the Term remove its trade fixtures, furniture and equipment; and (b) the Tenant shall at the end of the Term remove such of its trade fixtures, furniture, and equipment (including its computer/telephone equipment and all related wiring and cabling) and Leasehold Improvements installed by it as the Landlord shall require to be removed. For greater certainty and clarity, the Tenant covenants and agrees to remove any of its wiring/cabling from the Premises as the Landlord shall require to be removed. The Tenant shall, in the case of every removal either during or at the end of the Term, make good any damage caused to the Premises and/or the Building by the installation and removal.
