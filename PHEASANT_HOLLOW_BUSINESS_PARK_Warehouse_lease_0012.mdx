23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

21.01           Default by Tenant:     Upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each one an “Event of Default”), Tenant shall be deemed to be in default under the terms of this Lease.  Landlord may treat any such occurrence as a breach of this Lease and Landlord shall have the remedies set forth in Section 21.02:

(a)           Tenant fails to pay when due any rental or any other sum required to be paid hereunder and such failure is not cured within five (5) business days following written notice from Landlord to Tenant of such failure.

(b)           Tenant fails to perform or violates any other term, condition or covenant required to be performed by it pursuant to this Lease and such failure is not cured within ten (10) business days after written notice of such failure is given to Tenant by Landlord; or, if such failure cannot reasonably be cured within such ten (10) business days, if Tenant fails to commence the cure within ten (10) business days or thereafter fails to diligently prosecute such cure to completion.

21.02           Landlord’s Remedies:     Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 21.01, Landlord shall have the option to take any or all of the following actions, without further notice or demand of any kind to Tenant, or to any guarantor of this Lease, or to any other person:

(a)           Landlord, pursuant to summary ejectment or other legal process, may immediately reenter and remove all persons and property from the Premises, storing such property in a warehouse, or elsewhere at the Tenant’s cost, without being deemed guilty of, or liable in, trespass, forcible entry or in damages resulting from such reentry and removal.  No such reentry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord shall be construed as an election on its part to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such intention is given by Landlord to Tenant.  All property of Tenant which is stored by Landlord pursuant hereto may be redeemed by Tenant within thirty (30) days after Landlord takes possession thereof upon payment to Landlord in full of all obligations then due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder and of all costs incurred by Landlord in moving such property and providing such storage.  If Tenant fails to redeem such property within said thirty (30) day period, Landlord may sell such property in any reasonable manner and shall apply the proceeds of such sale actually collected first against the costs of moving, storage and sale and then against any other obligation due from Tenant under this Lease with any remaining surplus being remitted to Tenant.

(b)           Landlord may relet the Premises or any portion thereof at any time or from time to time and for such terms and upon such conditions and at such rental as Landlord, in its sole discretion, considers advisable.  Whether or not the Premises, or any portion thereof, are relet by Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all amounts required to be paid by Tenant hereunder up to the date that Landlord removes Tenant from the Premises, and thereafter Tenant shall pay to Landlord, until the end of the term, the amount of Minimum Base Rent and other amounts required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to this Lease.  Such payments by Tenant shall be due at such times as are provided elsewhere in this Lease, and Landlord need not wait until the termination of this Lease, through expiration of the term or otherwise, to recover such payments by legal action or in any other manner.  If Landlord relets the Premises, or any portion thereof, such reletting shall not relieve Tenant of any obligation hereunder, except that Landlord shall apply the rent or other proceeds actually collected by it as a result of such reletting (i) against the costs of removing Tenant and its property, (ii) against the costs of reletting including the cost of clean-up, repair or

23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

modification of the Premises and the fee of any Realtor, (iii) against any amount due from Tenant hereunder to the extent that such rent or other proceeds compensate Landlord for the

nonperformance of any obligation of Tenant hereunder, and (iv) any residue shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future rent as such may become due and payable hereunder.  Landlord may execute any lease made pursuant hereto in its own name and the tenant there under shall be under no obligation to control or monitor the application by Landlord of any rent or other proceeds paid to Landlord there under nor shall Tenant have any right to collect any portion of such rent or other proceeds nor be entitled to regain possession of the Premises.  Landlord shall not by any reentry or other act be deemed to have otherwise terminated this Lease, or to have relieved Tenant of any obligation hereunder, unless Landlord shall have given Tenant express written notice of Landlord’s election to do so.  Notwithstanding any such reletting without termination, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for any previous breach by Tenant.

(c)           Landlord may collect by suit or otherwise, without reletting the Premises, each installment of rent or other sum as it becomes due hereunder, or enforce, by suit or otherwise, any other covenant or obligation which is required to be performed by Tenant.  Landlord may also elect to cure any default on behalf of Tenant and, in such event, Tenant shall immediately reimburse Landlord for the costs so incurred.

(d)           Landlord may terminate this Lease by written notice to Tenant.  In the event of such termination, Tenant agrees to immediately surrender possession of the Premises.  Such termination shall not relieve Tenant of any obligation hereunder which has accrued prior to the date of such termination and Landlord may recover from Tenant all damages it has incurred by reason of Tenant’s breach, including the cost of recovering the Premises, reasonable attorneys fees, and the worth (or present value) at the time of such termination of the excess, if any, of the amount of rent and charges equivalent to rent reserved under this Lease for the remainder of the stated term over the then rental value of the Premises for the remainder of the stated term, all of which amounts shall be immediately due and payable from Tenant to Landlord.  The “worth or present value” shall be determined by using an interest rate of ten percent (10%) per annum or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.  In determining the amount of rent reserved under this Lease subsequent to such termination, the rent which would have been paid for each year of the unexpired term shall be deemed to equal the average yearly minimum and additional rents paid by Tenant hereunder from the Commencement Date to the time of default, or during the preceding three (3) full calendar years, whichever period is shorter.

(e)           The remedies given to Landlord in this Section 21 shall be cumulative and shall be in addition and supplemental to all other rights or remedies which Landlord may have at equity or under the laws then in force.

(f)           Landlord shall use commercially reasonable means to mitigate its damages.

21.03           Defaults by Landlord:     If Landlord fails to perform any of the terms, conditions or covenants contained in this Lease which are to be performed by Landlord and if such failure is not remedied within fifteen (15) days after written notice of such failure is given by Tenant to Landlord (or if more than fifteen (15) days shall be reasonably required to cure such failure, if

23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

Landlord does not commence to remedy such failure within such fifteen (15) days or thereafter does not proceed diligently to cure such failure), then in such event Landlord shall be deemed to be in default and shall be responsible to Tenant for any and all damages sustained by Tenant as a result of Landlord’s breach.  If the Premises or any part thereof are at any time subject to a mortgage or a deed of trust, Tenant shall also comply with the provisions of Section 24, Subordination Clause.  If, after compliance with this Section, Landlord has not cured such default, Tenant shall have the right to seek specific performance or to cure any such default at Landlord’s expense including in such expenditure all costs and attorneys’ fees and, thereafter, xxxx such     costs and attorneys’ fees to Landlord and demand immediate payment thereof.  If such payment is not made by Landlord, Tenant may proceed to collect the same through any legal action or may offset such against the next Minimum Base Rent and Tenant’s Proportionate Share rent due hereunder until such are recaptured.  Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease, however, unless Landlord violates Section 26 (Quiet Enjoyment) below.
