(b) In the event of default as defined in Subsection 14(a) hereof, Landlord, in addition to any and all legal and equitable remedies it may have, shall have the following remedies:

(i) To distrain for any rent or additional rent in default; and

(ii) At any time after default, without notice, to declare this Lease terminated and enter the Leased Premises with or without legal process; and in such event Landlord shall have the benefit of all provisions of law now or hereafter in force respecting the speedy recovery of possession from Tenant’s holding over or proceedings in forcible entry and detainer, and Tenant waives any and all provisions for notice under such laws.

Notwithstanding such reentry and/or termination, Tenant shall immediately be liable to Landlord for the sum of the following: (i) all minimum rent and additional rent then in arrears, without apportionment to the termination date, including Tenant’s taxes due for the year of termination, whether such termination is before or after July 1st of such year; (ii) all other liabilities of Tenant and damages sustained by Landlord as a result of Tenant’s default, including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of reletting the Leased Premises (including reasonable renovation costs) and any broker’s commissions payable as a result thereof; (iii) all of Landlord’s costs and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) in connection with such default and recovery of possession; (iv) the difference between the rent reserved under this Lease for the balance of the Term and the fair rental value of the Leased Premises for the balance of the Term to be determined as of the date of reentry; or at Landlord’s option in lieu thereof, Tenant shall pay the amount of the rent and additional rent reserved under this Lease at the times herein stipulated for payment of rent and additional rent for the balance of the Term, less any amount received by Landlord during such period from others to whom the Leased Premises may be rented on such terms and conditions and at such rentals as Landlord, in its sole discretion, shall deem proper; and (v) any other damages recoverable by law. In the event Landlord brings any action against Tenant to enforce compliance by Tenant with any covenant or condition of this Lease, including the covenant to pay rent, and it is judicially determined that Tenant has defaulted in performing or complying with any such covenant or condition, then and in such event, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in bringing and prosecuting such action against Tenant, including a reasonable attorneys’ fee.

(c) Any costs and expenses incurred by Landlord (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) in enforcing any of its rights or remedies under this Lease shall be deemed to be additional rent and shall be repaid to Landlord by Tenant upon demand.

(d) No payment of money by Tenant after the termination of this Lease, service of any notice, commencement of any suit, or after final judgment for possession of the Premises, shall reinstate this Lease or affect any such notice, demand or suit, or imply consent for any action for which Landlord’s consent is required. Should Landlord elect not to exercise its rights in the event of a default, it shall not be deemed a waiver of such rights as to subsequent defaults.
