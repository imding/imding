              Tenant hereby indemnifies and holds Landlord harmless from and against any Claims (defined in Section 14.2,
              below) arising out of, in connection with, or in any manner related to) all governmental fees, taxes, tariffs and other
              charges levied directly or indirectly against any personal property, fixtures, machinery, equipment, apparatus,
              systems, connections, interconnections and appurtenances located in or used by Tenant in or in connection with the
              Tenant Space. If any such taxes for which Tenant is liable are levied or assessed against Landlord or Landlord’s
              property, and if Landlord elects to pay the same, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, within ten (10)
              days of Landlord’s demand therefor, that part of such taxes for which Tenant is liable hereunder.

                   4.2 Additional Taxes. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent and within ten (10) days of Landlord’s
              demand therefor, and in such manner and at such times as Landlord shall direct from time to time by written notice

              account of (i) the Rent (and other amounts) payable by Tenant hereunder (or any other benefit received by Landlord
              hereunder), including, without limitation, any gross receipts tax, license fee or excise tax levied by any
              governmental authority, (ii) this Lease, Landlord’s business as a lessor hereunder, and the possession, leasing,

              5. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

              6. USE.
                   6.1 Permitted Use. Subject to the terms of this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall use the Tenant Space only for
              the installation, placement, operation and maintenance of computer, switch, transmission and/or communications
              equipment and connections (in accordance with Section 1.3, above) and/or provision of managed hosting and IP
              services and/or colocation services to Tenant’s subtenants and customers (in accordance with Section 10.6, below),
              and in any case for all purposes necessary or appropriate for data center and/or telecommunications center purposes
              (including without limitation (a) office and other associated uses and (b) use of the Ancillary Space, in accordance
              with the terms of Exhibit “A-1” and Exhibit “J”) (collectively, the “Permitted Use”). Any other use of the Tenant
              Space is subject to Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent may be withheld or conditioned in Landlord’s
              sole and absolute discretion.

                   6.2 Building Rules and Regulations. Tenant’s Permitted Use shall be subject to, and Tenant, and Tenant’s
              agents, employees and invitees shall comply fully with all requirements of the Building Rules and Regulations.
              Landlord shall at all times have the right to change, such rules and regulations or to amend or supplement them in
              such manner as may be deemed (by Landlord in the exercise of its sole but good faith discretion) advisable for the
              safety, care and cleanliness of the Tenant Space, the Building and the Property and for preservation of good order
              therein, all of which Building Rules and Regulations, as changed, amended, and/or supplemented from time to time,
              shall be fully carried out and strictly observed by Tenant; provided, however, that such changes to the Building
              Rules and Regulations may not increase Tenant’s monetary obligations under this Lease or restrict in any way
              Tenant’s operation in the Tenant Space twenty-four (24) hours per day seven (7) days per week during the Term. In
              the event of a conflict between the Building Rules and Regulations and the terms of this Lease, the terms of this
              Lease shall govern. Tenant shall further be responsible for the compliance with such Building Rules and Regulations
              (as the same may be changed, amended and/or supplemented from time to time) by the employees, agents and
              invitees of Tenant. Landlord shall apply the Building Rules and Regulations uniformly to the tenants of the Building.

                                                                            -9-

                   6.3 Compliance with Laws; Hazardous Materials.
                         6.3.1 Compliance with Laws. Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, shall timely take all action
              required to cause the Tenant Space to comply in all respects with all laws, ordinances, building codes, rules,
              regulations, orders and directives of any governmental authority having jurisdiction (including without limitation
              any certificate of occupancy), and all covenants, conditions and restrictions affecting the Property now or in the
              future applicable to the Tenant Space (collectively, “Applicable Laws”) and with all rules, orders, regulations and
              requirements of any applicable fire rating bureau or other organization performing a similar function. Tenant shall
              not use the Tenant Space, or permit the Tenant Space to be used, in any manner, or do or suffer any act in or about
              the Tenant Space which: (i) violates or conflicts with any Applicable Law; (ii) causes or is reasonably likely to cause
              damage to the Property, the Building, the Tenant Space or the Building and/or Property systems and equipment,
              including, without limitation, all fire/life safety, electrical, HVAC, plumbing or sprinkler, access control (including,
              without limitation, Landlord’s Access Control Systems), mechanical, telecommunications, elevator and escalator
              systems and equipment (collectively, the “Building Systems”); (iii) will invalidate or otherwise violates a
              requirement or condition of any fire, extended coverage or any other insurance policy covering the Property, the
              Building, and/or the Tenant Space, or the property located therein, or will increase the cost of any of the same
              (unless, at Landlord’s election, Landlord permits an activity which will cause an increase in any such insurance rates
              on the condition that Tenant shall agree in writing to pay any such increase to Landlord immediately upon demand
              as Additional Rent); (iv) constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience to
              other tenants or occupants of the Building or the Property, or any equipment, facilities or systems of any such
              Tenant; (v) interferes with, or is reasonably likely to interfere with, the transmission or reception of microwave,
              television, radio, telephone, or other communication signals by antennae or other facilities located at the Property;
              (vi) amounts to (or results in) the commission of waste in the Tenant Space, the Building or the Property;
              (vii) violates any of the rules and regulations from time to time promulgated by Landlord applicable to the Tenant
              Space, the Building or the Property (including, without limitation, the Building Rules and Regulations) (provided
              that this item (vii) shall not be deemed to allow Landlord to prohibit Tenant from running a data center in the
              Premises); or (viii) other than the Permitted Use. The foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord agrees (aa) to cause all
              other tenant spaces in the Building to be built out in accordance with Applicable Law; and (bb) to cause all other
              tenant leases for the Building to contain items (i)-(vii) of this Section 6.3.1. Subject to the provisions of
              Section 9.1.5, Tenant shall be responsible for any losses, costs or damages in the event that unauthorized parties gain
              access to the Tenant Space or the Building through access cards, keys or other access devices provided to Tenant by
              Landlord. Tenant shall promptly upon demand reimburse Landlord as additional rent for any additional premium
              charged for any insurance policy by reason of Tenant’s failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.3,
              subject to the notice and cure period described in Section 15.1.2 hereof.

                        6.3.2 Hazardous Materials. No Hazardous Materials (defined below) shall be Handled (defined below)
              upon, about, in, at, above or beneath the Tenant Space or any portion of the Building or the Property by or on behalf
              of Tenant, its Transferees (defined in 10.1, below), or their respective contractors, clients, officers, directors,
              employees, representatives, licensees, agents, or invitees (the “Tenant Parties”). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
              normal quantities of those Hazardous Materials customarily used in the conduct of the Permitted Use may be used at
              the Tenant Space without Landlord’s prior written consent, but only in compliance with all applicable
              Environmental Laws (defined below) and only in a manner consistent with Institutional Owner Practices (defined in
              Section 8.3, below). “Environmental Laws” shall mean and include all now and hereafter existing Applicable Laws
              regulating, relating to, or imposing liability or standards of conduct concerning public health and safety or the
              environment. “Hazardous Materials” shall mean and include: (1) any material or substance: (i) which is defined or
              becomes defined as a “hazardous substance,” “hazardous waste,” “infectious waste,” “chemical mixture or
              substance,” or “air pollutant” under Environmental Laws; (ii) containing petroleum, crude oil or any fraction
              thereof; (iii) containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB’s); (iv) asbestos, asbestos-containing materials or presumed
              asbestos-containing materials (collectively, “ACM”); (v) which is radioactive; (vi) which is

                                                                           -10-
                                                                 Data Center Lease




                                                                                                                                  Page

              infectious; or (2) any other material or substance displaying toxic, reactive, ignitable or corrosive characteristics, and
              are defined, or become defined by any Environmental Law. “Handle,” “Handled,” or “Handling” shall mean any
              installation, handling, generation, storage, treatment, use, disposal, discharge, release, manufacture, refinement,
              presence, migration, emission, abatement, removal, transportation, or any other activity of any type in connection
              with or involving Hazardous Materials. Landlord hereby represents and warrants that to the best of Landlord’s actual
              knowledge, neither the Building nor the Land contain any Hazardous Materials at levels or in conditions that are in
              violation of applicable Environmental Laws. As used herein, the phrase “Landlord’s actual knowledge”, or similar
              phrases, shall mean the actual current knowledge as of the date of this Lease of Christopher Crosby, Senior Vice
              President of Digital Realty Trust, L.P, and David J. Caron, Vice President of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. (the foregoing
              two (2) individuals, collectively, “Landlord’s Knowledge Parties”). In the event that Environmental Laws require
              Landlord to remove Hazardous Materials from any part of the Building or Land, that obligation shall be at
              Landlord’s sole cost and shall be limited to removal of Hazardous Materials which are in excess of the legal levels
              permitted by Environmental Laws, and which were not placed on the Property by Tenant (the prompt clean up of
              which, in accordance with Environmental Laws, shall be the responsibility of Tenant hereunder).

                   6.4 Electrical Consumption Threshold. Tenant’s actual electricity consumption for the Premises, as
              reasonably determined by Landlord pursuant to such measurement method or methods as Landlord shall employ
              from time to time acting consistently with Institutional Owner Practices (including, without limitation, the use of
              submeters and/or pulse meters, electrical surveys and/or engineer’s estimates), shall not at any time, exceed the
              number of watts for the Premises specified in Item 1 of Exhibit “F” (the “Electricity Consumption Threshold”).
              All equipment (belonging to Tenant or otherwise) located within the Premises shall be included in the calculation of
              Tenant’s actual electrical consumption for the Premises. The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event that Tenant
              wants to increase its Electricity Consumption Threshold with the utility provider, Landlord agrees to reasonably
              cooperate with Tenant in Tenant’s attempt to obtain such increase; provided that (a) such increase may not
              unreasonably decrease Landlord’s ability, vis a vis the utility provider, to obtain electrical power (on a watts per
              square foot basis commensurate with that of the Premises) for the balance of the Building; and (b) Tenant
              acknowledges that any such increase may increase the Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder.

                   6.5 Structural Load. Tenant shall not place a load upon the Premises exceeding the number of pounds of live
              load per square foot specified in Exhibit “F”. Any cabinets, cages or partitions installed by Landlord shall be
              included in the calculation of the live load.
