              (10) consecutive days or any vacation or abandonment of the Premises by Tenant which would cause any insurance
              policy to be invalidated or otherwise lapse, in each of the foregoing cases irrespective of whether or not Tenant is
              then in monetary default under this Lease. Tenant agrees to notice and service of notice as provided for in this Lease

              continuing for a period of five (5) business days after the same is due; provided, however, that any such notice shall
              be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any notice required under Section 1161, et seq. of the California Code of Civil
              Procedure or any successor statute hereinafter enacted;

                       (iii) A general assignment by Tenant or any guarantor or surety of Tenant’s obligations hereunder,

                       (iv) The filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy by Tenant or any Guarantor, the filing by Tenant or any
              Guarantor of a voluntary petition for an arrangement, the filing by or against Tenant or any Guarantor of a petition,
              voluntary or involuntary, for reorganization, or the filing of an involuntary petition by the creditors of Tenant or any
              Guarantor, said involuntary petition remaining undischarged for a period of sixty (60) days;


                         (v) Receivership, attachment, or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Tenant’s assets on the
              Premises, such attachment or other seizure remaining undismissed or undischarged for a period of sixty (60) days

                        (vii) Failure of Tenant to execute and deliver to Landlord any estoppel certificate, subordination agreement,

              by Tenant to deliver to Landlord any financial statement within the time period and in the manner required by
              Paragraph 40;

                       (viii) An assignment or sublease, or attempted assignment or sublease, of this Lease or the Premises by
              Tenant contrary to the provision of Paragraph 23, unless such assignment or sublease is expressly conditioned upon
              Tenant having received Landlord’s consent thereto;

                      (ix) Failure of Tenant to restore the Security Deposit to the amount and within the time period provided in

                        (x) Failure in the performance of any of Tenant’s covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder (except

              this Paragraph 24, which shall be governed by the notice and cure periods set forth in such other subparagraphs),
              which failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant, provided that, if
              Tenant has exercised reasonable diligence to cure such failure and such failure cannot be cured within such thirty
              (30) day period despite reasonable diligence, Tenant shall not be in default under this subparagraph so long as
              Tenant thereafter diligently and continuously prosecutes the cure to completion and actually completes such cure
              within sixty (60) days after the giving of the aforesaid written notice;

                       (xi) Chronic delinquency by Tenant in the payment of Rent, or any other periodic payments required to be
              paid by Tenant under this Lease. “Chronic delinquency” shall mean failure by Tenant to pay Rent, or any other
              payments required to be paid by Tenant under this Lease within five (5) business days after written notice thereof for
              any three (3) months (consecutive or nonconsecutive) during any period of twelve (12) months;

                        (xii) Chronic overuse by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents of parking areas designated for use by the occupants of
              other buildings in the Project. “Chronic overuse” shall mean use by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents of a number of
              parking spaces greater than the number of parking spaces set forth in the Basic Lease Information more than three
              (3) times during the Term after written notice by Landlord;

                       (xiii) Any insurance required to be maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall be canceled or
              terminated or shall expire or be reduced or materially changed, except as permitted in this Lease;



                        (xiv) Any failure by Tenant to discharge any lien or encumbrance placed on the Project or any part thereof
              in violation of this Lease within ten (10) days after the date such lien or encumbrance is filed or recorded against the
              Project or any part thereof;

                        (xv) Any failure by Tenant to immediately remove, abate or remedy any Hazardous Materials located in, on
              or about the Premises or the Building in connection with any failure by Tenant to comply with Tenant’s obligations
              under Paragraph 32;

                     (xvi) Tenant’s failure to commence business operations in the Premises within ninety (90) days following
              the Commencement Date, subject to delays beyond Tenant’s reasonable control (other than financial difficulty); and

                        (xvii) Any representation of Tenant herein or in any financial statement or other materials provided by
              Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease shall prove to be untrue or inaccurate in any
              material respect, or any such financial statements or other materials shall have omitted any material fact.

              Tenant agrees that any notice given by Landlord pursuant to Paragraph 24(a)(ii) above shall satisfy the requirements
              for notice under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161, and Landlord shall not be required to give any
              additional notice in order to be entitled to commence an unlawful detainer proceeding.

                   (b) Landlord’s Default. If Landlord fails to perform its obligations under this Lease, Landlord shall not be in
              default unless Landlord fails to perform such obligations within thirty (30) days after notice by Tenant to Landlord
              specifying the nature of the obligations Landlord has failed to perform; provided, however, that if the nature of
              Landlord’s obligations is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for performance, then Landlord shall not
              be in default if Landlord commences performance within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently
              prosecutes the same to completion. If Landlord is unable to fulfill or is delayed in fulfilling any of Landlord’s
              obligations under this Lease by reason of floods, earthquakes, lightning, or any other acts of God, accidents,
              breakage, repairs, strikes, lockouts, other labor disputes, inability to obtain utilities or materials, or by any other
              reason beyond Landlord’s reasonable control, or if Landlord enters the Premises or makes any Alterations to the
              Premises, the Building or any portion thereof pursuant to this Lease, then no such inability or delay by Landlord and
              no such entry or work by Landlord shall constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle
              Tenant to any abatement or diminution of Rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease, or
              impose any liability upon Landlord or its agents. Except as expressly provided to the contrary in Paragraph 5(d) and
              Paragraphs 21 and 22, this Lease shall be construed as though the covenants herein between Landlord and Tenant
              are independent, and Tenant shall not be entitled to any setoff, offset, abatement or deduction of Rent or other
              amounts due Landlord hereunder if Landlord fails to perform its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding any
              provision of this Lease to the contrary, Tenant’s sole remedy for a default of this Lease by Landlord shall be an
              action for damages, injunction or specific performance; Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease on account
              of any breach of default by Landlord.
