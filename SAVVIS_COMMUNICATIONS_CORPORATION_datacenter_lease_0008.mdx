              7. SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THE TENANT SPACE.
                   7.1 Access Control. Landlord will provide access control as follows: (i) Landlord will operate a check-in desk
              at the Building’s main entrance twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, (ii) Landlord will provide
              an electronic “key card” system to control access to the Building, and (iii) Landlord has will provide a video
              surveillance system in the Building (collectively, “Landlord’s Access Control Systems”). Landlord disclaims any
              and all other responsibility or, obligation to provide additional access control (or any security) to the Building, the
              Tenant Space, or any portion of any of the above. Landlord reserves the right, to be exercised by Landlord in its sole
              and absolute discretion, but without assuming any duty, to institute additional access control measures in order to
              further control and regulate access to the Building, or any part thereof. Landlord shall not, under any circumstances,
              be responsible for providing or supplying security services to the Tenant Space or any part of the Building in excess
              of the Landlord’s Access Control Systems expressly set forth in this Section 7.1 (and Landlord shall not under any
              circumstances be deemed to have agreed to provide any services in excess of the above specified Landlord’s Access
              Control Systems). Subject to Landlord’s approval of the plans and specifications therefor and the contractors who
              will perform such work, Tenant may install, at its sole cost and expense, its own security system (“Tenant’s
              Security System”) for the Premises. Tenant shall furnish Landlord with a copy of all key codes, access cards and
              other entry means and ensure that Landlord shall have access to the Premises at all times,

                                                                           -11-
                                                                 Data Center Lease




                                                                                                                                  Page

              subject to Landlord’s compliance with Tenant’s security procedures in accordance with the terms of Section 17.17
              hereof. Additionally, Tenant shall ensure that Tenant’s Security System shall comply with all applicable laws,
              ordinances, rules and regulations, including all fire safety laws, and in no event shall Landlord be liable for the
              malfunctioning thereof. Tenant shall have the right, subject to Landlord’s reasonable approval and at its sole cost and
              expense, to integrate Tenant’s security system and management systems into Landlord’s Building security system
              and Building management systems. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that it understands that all persons in the
              Building and the activities of all such persons are and shall be subject to surveillance by video camera and/or
              otherwise by Landlord’s agents and employees.

                    7.2 Electricity. Landlord shall furnish electricity to the Premises in accordance with the specifications set forth
              in Item 1 of Exhibit “F” attached hereto. The obligation of Landlord to provide electricity to the Tenant Space shall
              be subject to the rules and regulations of the supplier of such electricity and of any governmental authorities
              regulating providers of electricity and shall be limited to providing the Electricity Consumption Threshold (as
              defined in Section 6.4). Except as expressly set forth in Exhibit “F”, Tenant shall be solely responsible for all
              emergency, supplemental or back-up power systems (“Back-Up Power”) for use in the Tenant Space.

                   7.3 Water. Landlord shall furnish hot and cold water at those points of supply provided for general use therein.

                   7.4 Janitorial Service. Landlord shall furnish janitorial service in and about the Common Areas of the
              Building, as may, in the judgment of Landlord, be reasonably required; but shall not be required to furnish janitorial
              services to the Tenant Space.

                 7.5 Loading Dock. Tenant shall have reasonable access to a loading dock and a freight elevator at all times (in
              common with other tenants of the Building), subject to the Building Rules and Regulations.

                  7.6 Life Safety. Landlord agrees to maintain the fire suppression and life safety systems of the Building in
              accordance with Applicable Law.

                   7.7 Interruption of Services.
                         7.7.1 Landlord shall not be liable or responsible to Tenant for any loss, damage or expense of any type
              which Tenant may sustain or incur if the quantity or character of the utility provided electric service is changed by
              the utility company, is no longer provided by the utility company, or is no longer suitable for Tenant’s requirements.
              No interruption or malfunction of any electrical or other service (including, without limitation, heating ventilation
              and air conditioning “HVAC”) to the Tenant Space (or to any other portion of the Building or Property) shall, in any
              event, (i) constitute an eviction or disturbance of Tenant’s use and possession of the Tenant Space, (ii) constitute a
              breach by Landlord of any of Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, (iii) render Landlord liable for damages of
              any type or entitle Tenant to be relieved from any of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease (including the obligation
              to pay Base Rent, Additional Rent, or other charges), (iv) grant Tenant any right of setoff or recoupment, (v) provide
              Tenant with any right to terminate this Lease, or (vi) make Landlord liable for any injury to or interference with
              Tenant’s business or any punitive, incidental or consequential damages (of any type), whether foreseeable or not,
              whether arising from or relating to the making of or failure to make any repairs, alterations or improvements, or
              whether arising from or related to the provision of or failure to provide for or to restore any service in or to any
              portion of the Property or the Building. In the event of any interruption, however, Landlord shall employ
              commercially reasonable efforts to restore such service or cause the same to be restored in any circumstances in
              which such restoration is within the reasonable control of Landlord and the interruption at issue was not caused in
              whole or in part by any action of Tenant.

                                                                           -12-





                                                                                                                                 Page

                       7.7.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any interruption of any electrical or other service
              (including, without limitation, HVAC) to the Tenant Space, or any portion thereof, was not caused by any act or
              omission of Tenant or Tenant’s employees, agents, invitees or contractors, and, in Tenant’s good faith determination,
              Tenant is prevented from using (and actually does not use) the Tenant Space or any portion thereof for a period in
              excess of the timeframe specified in Item 15 of the Basic Lease Information (the “Eligibility Period”) because of
              the unavailability of any such service, Tenant shall, as its exclusive remedy therefor, be entitled to an equitable
              abatement of Rent commencing on the day after the expiration of such Eligibility Period and continuing for each
              consecutive day thereafter that Tenant is so prevented from using (and does not use) the Tenant Space.

              8. MAINTENANCE; ALTERATIONS.
                   8.1 Landlord Maintenance. Except as provided in this Section 8.1, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair
              and/or maintain the Tenant Space. Landlord will maintain and keep in good repair and first class condition,
              consistent with standards in effect at other first class data centers in the United States of America, the Common Area
              floors, those walls in the Tenant Space that are structural in nature, the foundation (including soil preparation
              sufficient to support the structural load specified in Exhibit “F”), steel structure, exterior walls (including windows)
              and roof of the Building, the public areas (including all of the Common Areas) within and outside of the Building,
              the Building’s life safety system, the Building’s water and sewer system, the Building’s electrical grounding system,
              the Building’s electrical system, the heating, air conditioning and ventilation system within the Building’s Common
              Area, Landlord’s Access Control Systems, the Building switch gear, the telecommunications conduits, risers, cables,
              vaults and manholes including the redundant multi-carrier multi-location access point for fiber and power services,
              all equipment, furnishings, fixtures and other personal property used by Landlord in the operation of the Building,
              the Building’s fire sprinkler system, the Building’s fire alarm system, any portion of the enclosed yard area which is
              common area for data center services and the parking and grounds adjacent to the Building (the “Base Building”).
              Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule, perform (and cause others to schedule and perform)
              all work related to its maintenance obligations in a manner that minimizes unreasonable interruption or disruption of
              Tenant’s use of Tenant’s Space, or the operations performed therein. For the purposes of this Lease, (i) the term
              “Switch Gear Repair” shall mean and refer to the repair by Landlord of the Building’s switch gear necessitated by
              the malfunction or other “break-down” of such switch gear; and (ii) the term “Water Repair” shall mean and refer
              to the repair by Landlord of a water leak in the Building, including a roof leak, window leak, foundation leak,
              exterior wall leak or the Building’s plumbing system within the Common Area.

                   8.2 Tenant’s Maintenance. During the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense,
              maintain the Tenant Space and Tenant’s equipment therein in a clean, sightly, safe and good order and clean
              condition (and in at least as good order and clean condition as when Tenant took possession), ordinary wear and tear
              and damage by Casualty and Taking excepted. If Tenant fails to perform its covenants of maintenance and repair
              hereunder, or if Tenant or any of Tenant’s technicians or representatives physically damages the Property, the
              Building, or any portion of any of the above, or the personal property of any other tenant or occupant, Landlord may,
              but shall not be obligated to (after notice by Landlord to Tenant and failure by Tenant to cure within ten (10) days
              after such notice) perform all necessary or appropriate maintenance and repair, and any amounts expended by
              Landlord in connection therewith, plus an administrative charge of ten percent (10%), shall be reimbursed by Tenant
              to Landlord as additional rent within thirty (30) days after Landlord’s demand therefor. For the avoidance of doubt,
              Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that the foregoing ten (10) day notice period is a notice period that runs
              concurrently with the Event of Default notice and cure period described in Article 15 hereof; and, in no event, shall
              such ten (10) day cure period be deemed to be an additional notice period that precedes the Event of Default notice
              period.

                  8.3 Alterations. Notwithstanding any provision in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not make or cause to
              be made any alterations, additions, improvements or replacements to the Tenant Space, or any other portion of the
              Building or Property
                                                                Data Center Lease




                                                                           -13-
                                                                Data Center Lease




                                                                                                                                Page

              (collectively, “Alterations”) without the prior written consent and approval of Landlord, which consent and
              approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that Landlord’s consent
              shall not be required for any usual and customary installations, repairs, maintenance, and removals of equipment and
              telecommunication cables within the Tenant Space if and to the extent that such installations, repairs, maintenance,
              and removals (i) are usual and customary within the industry, (ii) are in compliance with the Building Rules and
              Regulations, and (iii) will not affect the Building’s structure, the provision of services to other Building tenants, or
              the Building’s electrical, plumbing, HVAC, life safety or mechanical systems. For example, Landlord’s consent
              would be required for the installation of overhead ladder racks that are attached to the ceiling and Landlord’s
              consent would not be required for the installation of equipment which does not involve drilling into the floor or
              ceiling. The foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that if, as and when the items
              listed on Exhibit “E-2” are placed, constructed and/or installed in the Tenant Space such items shall be deemed to
              be included in the definition of “Alterations” as described above. Landlord and Tenant agree that, during the first
              (1st) year of the Term, Landlord shall provide its consent (or objections) with regard to Tenant’s requests for
              Alteration consent within five (5) days after Landlord’s receipt of such request, and, within ten (10) days after
              Landlord’s receipt for each year of the Term occurring after the first year of the Term. In the event that Landlord has
              failed to provide its consent (or objections) within the prescribed five (5) or ten (10) day period, as applicable,
              Landlord will be deemed to have consented with regard to the applicable request for Alterations consent; provided
              that (i) such request for Alterations consent contains the phrase “DATED MATERIAL ENCLOSED. RESPONSE IS
              REQUIRED WITHIN (“FIVE” or “TEN”, as applicable) DAYS AFTER LANDLORD’S RECEIPT HEREOF”, in
              all capital letters (no smaller than sixteen (16) point font) on the outside of the package in which such request for
              Alterations consent is provided to Landlord; (ii) such request for Alterations consent contains three (3) full sets of
              drawings (two full size hard copies, and one full set of drawings on CD); and (iii) in the event that Landlord has not
              responded within the applicable notice period, Tenant agrees to provide Landlord one (1) additional written notice
              and one (1) additional business day’s notice in which to respond, prior to such deemed approval taking effect. The
              foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that Tenant shall, subject to (aa) Landlord’s
              reasonable approval of the plans and specifications therefor; (bb) Tenant’s compliance with the insurance
              requirements hereof; and (cc) Tenant’s compliance with Landlord’s safety requirements for the Building, be
              permitted to construct a facility in the Premises that will support the Permitted Use. Landlord and Tenant agree that
              such permission to construct includes permission to access the loading dock, elevator and Building systems in
              connection with such construction, but subject to the terms and conditions otherwise contained herein. For the
              avoidance of doubt, Landlord and Tenant agree that Tenant shall be permitted to take the depreciation for tax
              purposes with regard all Alterations and with regard Tenant’s Personal Property (as defined hereinafter). The
              foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord hereby grants Tenant its consent with regard to Tenant contracting with NOVA
              Corporation (“NOVA”), as Tenant’s primary general contractor for the initial Alterations in the Premises; provided
              that (i) NOVA must comply with the terms of this Lease, including, but not limited to NOVA’s compliance with the
              Building Rules & Regulations; (ii) NOVA must work in harmony with Landlord and Landlord’s agents, contractors,
              workmen, mechanics and suppliers and with other tenants and occupants of the Building; and (iii) NOVA must
              furnish Landlord with such insurance as Landlord may reasonably require against liabilities which may arise out of
              work performed in the Building by or for NOVA.

                   8.4 Removal of Cable, Wiring, Connecting Lines, Equipment, Personal Property and Alterations.
                       8.4.1 Tenant agrees that, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant (or, failing which,
              a contractor designated by Landlord) shall, to the extent required by Applicable Law, and at Tenant’s sole cost and
              expense, promptly remove Tenant’s Personal Property (defined below) and Alterations, and shall restore those
              portions of the Building and/or the Tenant Space damaged by such removal of such Tenant’s Personal Property and
              Alterations to their condition immediately prior to the installation or placement of such items ordinary wear and tear
              and damage by Casualty or Taking excepted.

                                                                           -14-





                                                                                                                                Page

                        8.4.2 To the extent that the removals described in Section 8.4.1 above are not required by Applicable Law,
              Tenant agrees that, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant (or, failing which, a contractor
              designated by Landlord) shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, promptly remove all of Tenant’s Personal Property
              (defined below) and all of the Alterations, and shall restore those portions of the Building and/or the Tenant Space
              damaged by such removal of such Tenant’s Personal Property and Alterations to their condition immediately prior to
              the installation or placement of such items ordinary wear and tear and damage by Casualty or Taking excepted;
              provided, however, that, rather than removing all of Tenant’s Personal Property or all of the Alterations, as described
              above, Tenant shall have the options to remove none of Tenant’s Personal Property, to remove none of the
              Alterations or to remove none of both. For the avoidance of doubt, however, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and
              agree that, with regard to Tenant’s removal of Tenant’s Personal Property and with regard to Tenant’s removal of the
              Alterations, each such removal shall be “all” or “none”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right
              to remove any or all of its unattached furniture and office supplies.

                        8.4.3 Remedies Related to Partial Removal. If Tenant removes some, but not all, of Tenant’s Personal
              Property (the “Leftover Personal Property”), or Tenant removes some, but not all, of the Alterations (the
              “Leftover Alterations”), but fails to promptly remove the balance of the Leftover Personal Property or the Leftover
              Alterations, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 8.4, Landlord shall have the right to remove such Leftover
              Personal Property and such Leftover Alterations and to restore those portions of the Building and/or the Tenant
              Space damaged by such removal to their condition immediately prior to the installation or placement of such
              Leftover Personal Property and Leftover Alterations, in which case Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord within
              thirty (30) days of Landlord’s demand therefor, for all of Landlord’s costs of removal and restoration plus an
              administrative fee equal to ten percent (10%) of such cost.

                       8.4.4 For purposes hereof, “Tenant’s Personal Property” shall mean, collectively, all communications
              cable, wiring and connecting lines, and all furniture, servers, cabinets, cages, computing & network gear, cable
              management system, including ladder racks & fiber trays, and other equipment installed, supporting or placed by or
              for on behalf of Tenant anywhere in the Building and/or the Tenant Space, but not including any items contained
              within the description of “Alterations” hereunder.

                       8.4.5 The provisions of this Section 8.4 are subject to the provisions of the CAA (defined hereinafter), or
              any successor lender’s collateral access agreement to which Landlord agrees, all in accordance with Section 12.4
              hereof.
