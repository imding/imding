23. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING
                    (a) Tenant shall not voluntarily or by operation of law, (1) mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or encumber this
              Lease or any interest herein, (2) assign or transfer this Lease or any interest herein, sublease the Premises or any part
              thereof, or any right or privilege appurtenant thereto, or allow any other person (the employees and invitees of
              Tenant excepted) to occupy or use the Premises, or any portion thereof, without first obtaining the written consent of
              Landlord, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably as set forth below in this Paragraph 23 provided that
              (i) Tenant is not then in Default under this Lease nor is any event then occurring which with the giving of notice or
              the passage of time, or both, would constitute a Default hereunder, and (ii) Tenant has not previously assigned or
              transferred this Lease or any interest herein or subleased the Premises or any part thereof. A transfer of greater than a
              fifty percent (50%) interest (whether stock, partnership interest, membership interest or otherwise) of Tenant, either
              in one (1) transaction or a series of transactions shall be deemed to be an assignment under this Lease.

                   (b) When Tenant requests Landlord’s consent to such assignment or subletting, it shall notify Landlord in
              writing of the name and address of the proposed assignee or subtenant and the nature and character of the business
              of the proposed assignee or subtenant and shall provide current and prior financial statements for the proposed
              assignee or subtenant, which financial statements shall be audited to the extent available and shall in any event be
              prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Tenant shall also provide Landlord with a
              copy of the proposed sublease or assignment agreement, including all material terms and conditions thereof.
              Landlord shall have the option, to be exercised within thirty (30) days of receipt of the foregoing, to (1) terminate
              this Lease as of the commencement date stated in the proposed sublease or assignment, but only if Tenant proposes
              to assign all of its interest in this Lease or sublet fifty percent (50%) or more of the rentable area of the Building,
              (2) sublease or take an assignment, as the case may be, from Tenant of the interest, or any portion thereof, in this
              Lease and/or the Premises that Tenant proposes to assign or sublease, on the same terms and conditions as stated in
              the proposed sublet or assignment agreement, (3) consent to the proposed assignment or sublease, or (4) refuse its
              consent to the proposed assignment or sublease, providing that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld so
              long as Tenant is not then in Default under this Lease nor is any event then occurring which with the giving of notice
              or the


              passage of time, or both, would constitute a Default hereunder. In the event Landlord elects to terminate this Lease
              or sublease or take an assignment from Tenant of the interest, or portion thereof, in this Lease and/or the Premises
              that Tenant proposes to assign or sublease as provided in the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), respectively, then
              Landlord shall have the additional right to negotiate directly with Tenant’s proposed assignee or subtenant and to
              enter into a direct lease or occupancy agreement with such party on such terms as shall be acceptable to Landlord in
              its sole and absolute discretion, and Tenant hereby waives any claims against Landlord related thereto, including,
              without limitation, any claims for any compensation or profit related to such lease or occupancy agreement.

                   (c) Without otherwise limiting the criteria upon which Landlord may withhold its consent, Landlord shall be
              entitled to consider all reasonable criteria including, but not limited to, the following: (1) whether or not the
              proposed subtenant or assignee is engaged in a business which, and the use of the Premises will be in an manner
              which, is in keeping with the then character and nature of all other tenancies in the Project, (2) whether the use to be
              made of the Premises by the proposed subtenant or assignee will conflict with any so-called “exclusive” use then in
              favor of any other tenant of the Building or the Project, and whether such use would be prohibited by any other
              portion of this Lease, including, but not limited to, any rules and regulations then in effect, or under applicable
              Laws, and whether such use imposes a greater load upon the Premises and the Building and Project services then
              imposed by Tenant, (3) the business reputation of the proposed individuals who will be managing and operating the
              business operations of the assignee or subtenant, and the long-term financial and competitive business prospects of
              the proposed assignee or subtenant, and (4) the creditworthiness and financial stability of the proposed assignee or
              subtenant in light of the responsibilities involved. In any event, Landlord may withhold its consent to any
              assignment or sublease, if (i) the actual use proposed to be conducted in the Premises or portion thereof conflicts
              with the provisions of Paragraph 9(a) or (b) above or with any other lease which restricts the use to which any space
              in the Building or the Project may be put, (ii) the portion of the Premises proposed to be sublet is irregular in shape
              and/or does not permit safe or otherwise appropriate means of ingress and egress, or does not comply with
              governmental safety and other codes, (iii) the proposed sublessee or assignee is either a governmental agency or
              instrumentality thereof; (iv) the proposed sublessee or assignee, or any person or entity which directly or indirectly,
              controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the proposed sublessee or assignee, either (x) occupies
              space in the Project at the time of the request for consent, or (y) is negotiating with Landlord or has negotiated with
              Landlord to lease space in the Project during the six (6) month period immediately preceding the date Landlord
              receives Tenant’s request for consent; and (v) if the proposed subtenant or assignee is a Prohibited Person, as defined
              in Paragraph 48.

                   (d) As a further condition to any rights Tenant may have under this Lease to sublet all or any portion of the
              Premises, Tenant shall offer space for sublease at a starting base rental rate no lower than Landlord’s then current
              highest asking base rental rate for comparable space in the Project which is then on the market for direct lease. If
              there is no comparable space in the Project then currently on the market for direct lease, Tenant shall offer the space
              for sublease at a starting base rental rate no lower than the fair market rental rate for such space.

                  (e) If Landlord approves an assignment or subletting as herein provided, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as
              Additional Rent, fifty percent (50%) of the excess, if any, rent and any


              additional rent or other concessions payable by the assignee or sublessee to Tenant, less reasonable and customary
              market-based leasing commissions, if any, incurred by Tenant in connection with such assignment or sublease,
              which commissions shall, for purposes of the aforesaid calculation, be amortized on a straight-line basis over the
              term of such assignment or sublease, minus (2) Base Rent plus Additional Rent allocable to that part of the Premises
              affected by such assignment or sublease pursuant to the provisions of this Lease. The assignment or sublease
              agreement, as the case may be, after approval by Landlord, shall not be amended without Landlord’s prior written
              consent, and shall contain a provision directing the assignee or subtenant to pay the rent and other sums due
              thereunder directly to Landlord upon receiving written notice from Landlord that Tenant is in default under this
              Lease with respect to the payment of Rent. In the event that, notwithstanding the giving of such notice, Tenant
              collects any rent or other sums from the assignee or subtenant, then Tenant shall hold such sums in trust for the
              benefit of Landlord and shall immediately forward the same to Landlord. Landlord’s collection of such rent and
              other sums shall not constitute an acceptance by Landlord of attornment by such assignee or subtenant. A consent to
              one assignment, subletting, occupation or use shall not be deemed to be a consent to any other or subsequent
              assignment, subletting, occupation or use, and consent to any assignment or subletting shall in no way relieve Tenant
              of any liability under this Lease. Any assignment or subletting without Landlord’s consent shall be void, and shall, at
              the option of Landlord, constitute a Default under this Lease.

                   (f) Notwithstanding any assignment or subletting, Tenant and any guarantor or surety of Tenant’s obligations
              under this Lease shall at all times remain fully and primarily responsible and liable for the payment of the Rent and
              for compliance with all of Tenant’s other obligations under this Lease (regardless of whether Landlord’s approval
              has been obtained for any such assignment or subletting).

                  (g) Tenant shall pay Landlord’s reasonable fees (including, without limitation, the fees of Landlord’s counsel),
              incurred in connection with Landlord’s review and processing of documents regarding any proposed assignment or
              sublease.

                   (h) A consent to one assignment, subletting, occupation or use shall not be deemed to be a consent to any other
              or subsequent assignment, subletting, occupation or use, and consent to any assignment or subletting shall in no way
              relieve Tenant of any liability under this Lease. Any assignment or subletting without Landlord’s consent shall be
              void, and shall, at the option of Landlord, constitute a Default under this Lease.

                   (i) Tenant acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions, conditions and limitations imposed by this
              Paragraph 23 on Tenant’s ability to assign or transfer this Lease or any interest herein, to sublet the Premises or any
              part thereof, to transfer or assign any right or privilege appurtenant to the Premises, or to allow any other person to
              occupy or use the Premises or any portion thereof, are, for the purposes of California Civil Code Section 1951.4, as
              amended from time to time, and for all other purposes, reasonable at the time that this Lease was entered into, and
              shall be deemed to be reasonable at the time that Tenant seeks to assign or transfer this Lease or any interest herein,
              to sublet the Premises or any part thereof, to transfer or assign any right or privilege appurtenant to the Premises, or
              to allow any other person to occupy or use the Premises or any portion thereof.



                   (j) Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, in the event Landlord consents to an assignment or
              subletting by Tenant in accordance with the terms of this Paragraph 23, Tenant’s assignee or subtenant shall have no
              right to further assign this Lease or any interest therein or thereunder or to further sublease all or any portion of the
              Premises. In furtherance of the foregoing, Tenant acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and any assignee or
              subtenant claiming under it (and any such assignee or subtenant by accepting such assignment or sublease shall be
              deemed to acknowledge and agree) that no sub-subleases or further assignments of this Lease shall be permitted at
              any time.

                   (k) If this Lease is assigned, whether or not in violation of the provisions of this Lease, Landlord may collect
              Rent from the assignee. If the Premises or any part thereof is sublet or used or occupied by anyone other than
              Tenant, whether or not in violation of this Lease, Landlord may, after Default by Tenant, collect Rent from the
              subtenant or occupant. In either event, Landlord may apply the net amount collected to Rent, but no such
              assignment, subletting, occupancy or collection shall be deemed a waiver of any of the provisions of this
              Paragraph 23, or the acceptance of the assignee, subtenant or occupant as tenant, or a release of Tenant from the
              further performance by Tenant of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease. The consent by Landlord to an assignment,
              mortgaging, pledging, encumbering, transfer, use, occupancy or subletting pursuant to any provision of this Lease
              shall not, except as otherwise provided herein, in any way be considered to relieve Tenant from obtaining the
              express consent of Landlord to any other or further assignment, mortgaging, pledging, encumbering, transfer, use,
              occupancy or subletting. References in this Lease to use or occupancy by anyone other than Tenant shall not be
              construed as limited to subtenants and those claiming under or through subtenants but as including also licensees or
              others claiming under or through Tenant, immediately or remotely. The listing of any name other than that of Tenant
              on any door of the Premises or on any directory or in any elevator in the Building, or otherwise, shall not, except as
              otherwise provided herein, operate to vest in the person so named any right or interest in this Lease or in the
              Premises, or be deemed to constitute, or serve as a substitute for, or any waiver of, any prior consent of Landlord
              required under this Paragraph 23.

                   (l) Each subletting and/or assignment pursuant to this Paragraph shall be subject to all of the covenants,
              agreements, terms, provisions and conditions contained in this Lease and each of the covenants, agreements, terms,
              provisions and conditions of this Lease shall be automatically incorporated therein. If Landlord shall consent to, or
              reasonably withhold its consent to, any proposed assignment or sublease, Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold
              harmless Landlord against and from any and all loss, liability, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable
              counsel fees) resulting from any claims that may be made against Landlord by the proposed assignee or sublessee or
              by any brokers or other persons claiming a commission or similar fee in connection with the proposed assignment or
              sublease.

                   (m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Paragraph 23, Tenant, during the initial Term,
              upon written notice to Landlord, but without Landlord’s consent, may assign this Lease to a corporation or other
              business entity (each herein called a “Related Corporation”) which shall control, be controlled by, or be under
              common control with, Tenant, provided that such Related Corporation does not store, use, or maintain hazardous
              materials at the Premises, and provided, further, that in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, the Tangible Net Worth of
              the Related Corporation immediately following the assignment is substantially equal to



              the greater of the Tangible Net Worth of Tenant on the date of this Lease or the Tangible Net Worth of Tenant on the
              date immediately preceding the commencement date of the proposed assignment, and proof reasonably satisfactory
              to Landlord of such Tangible Net Worth shall have been delivered to Landlord at least thirty (30) days prior to the
              commencement date of the proposed assignment. The term “Tangible Net Worth” shall mean the excess of total
              assets over total liabilities, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
              excluding, however, from the determination of total assets, goodwill and other intangibles. Concurrently with
              providing notice to Landlord of the assignment to a Related Corporation, Tenant shall he required to submit
              reasonably satisfactory evidence that the assignee is a Related Corporation, together with an executed counterpart of
              the document effecting the assignment. As used herein in defining Related Corporation, control must include over
              fifty percent (50%) of the stock or other voting interest of the controlled corporation or other business entity. Similar
              evidence that such assignee continues to be a Related Corporation shall be furnished by Tenant to Landlord within
              fifteen (15) days after request therefor, provided such request is not made more often than annually. Any assignment
              to a Related Corporation shall not relieve Tenant from liability under this Lease.
