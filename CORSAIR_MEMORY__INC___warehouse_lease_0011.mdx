21. DESTRUCTION AND DAMAGE
                   (a) If the Building is damaged by fire or other perils, whether or not covered by extended coverage insurance,
              Tenant shall give Landlord immediate notice thereof. If the peril causing such damage is covered by Landlord’s
              insurance, Landlord shall, at Landlord’s option:

                        (1) In the event of total destruction (which shall mean destruction or damage in excess of twenty-five
              percent (25%) of the full insurable value thereof) of the Building, elect either to commence promptly to repair and
              restore the Building and prosecute the same diligently to completion, in which event this Lease shall remain in full
              force and effect; or not to repair or restore the Building, in which event this Lease shall terminate. Landlord shall
              give Tenant written notice of its intention within sixty (60) days after the date (the “Casualty Discovery Date”)
              Landlord obtains actual knowledge of such destruction. If Landlord elects not to restore the Building, this Lease
              shall be deemed to have terminated as of the Casualty Discovery Date.

                        (2) In the event of a partial destruction (which shall mean destruction or damage to an extent not exceeding
              twenty-five percent (25%) of the full insurable value thereof) of the Building for which Landlord will receive
              insurance proceeds sufficient to cover the cost to repair and restore such partial destruction and, if the damage
              thereto is such that the Building may be substantially repaired or restored to its condition existing immediately prior
              to such damage or destruction within two hundred seventy (270) days from the Casualty Discovery Date, Landlord
              shall commence and proceed diligently with the work of repair and restoration, in which event this Lease shall
              continue in full force and effect. If such repair and restoration requires longer than two hundred seventy (270) days
              or if insurance proceeds therefor (if any), plus any amounts Tenant may elect or is obligated to contribute, are not
              sufficient to cover the cost of such repair and restoration, Landlord may elect either to so repair and restore, in which
              event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, or not to repair or restore, in which event this Lease shall
              terminate. In either case, Landlord shall give written notice to Tenant of its intention within sixty (60) days after the
              Casualty Discovery Date. If Landlord elects not to restore the Building, this Lease shall be deemed to have
              terminated as of the Casualty Discovery Date.

                       (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Paragraph, in the event of damage to the
              Building occurring during the last twelve (12) months of the Term, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease by
              written notice of such election given to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the Casualty Discovery Date.




                   (b) If the Building is damaged by any peril not fully covered by insurance proceeds to be received by Landlord,
              and the cost to repair such damage exceeds any amount Tenant may agree to contribute, Landlord may elect either to
              commence promptly to repair and restore the Building and prosecute the same diligently to completion, in which
              event this Lease shall remain in full force and effect; or not to repair or restore the Building, in which event this
              Lease shall terminate. Landlord shall give Tenant written notice of its intention within sixty (60) days after the
              Casualty Discovery Date. If Landlord elects not to restore the Building, this Lease shall be deemed to have
              terminated as of the date on which Tenant surrenders possession of the Building to Landlord, except that if the
              damage to the Building materially impairs Tenant’s ability to continue its business operations in the Building, then
              this Lease shall be deemed to have terminated as of the date such damage occurred.

                   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph 21, Landlord shall have the option to terminate
              this Lease, exercisable by notice to Tenant within sixty (60) days after the Casualty Discovery Date, in each of the
              following instances:

                        (1) Intentionally Deleted.

                      (2) If the Building or any portion thereof is damaged or destroyed and the repair and restoration of such
              damage requires longer than two hundred seventy (270) days from the Casualty Discovery Date.

                       (3) If the Building or the Premises or any portion thereof is damaged or destroyed and the insurance
              proceeds therefor are not sufficient to cover the costs of repair and restoration.

                        (4) Intentionally Deleted.

                   (d) In the event of repair and restoration as herein provided, the monthly installments of Base Rent shall be
              abated proportionately in the ratio which Tenant’s use of the Building is impaired during the period of such repair or
              restoration, but only to the extent of rental abatement insurance proceeds received by Landlord; provided, however,
              that Tenant shall not be entitled to such abatement to the extent that such damage or destruction resulted from the
              acts or inaction of Tenant or Tenant’s Agents. Except as expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence
              with respect to abatement of Base Rent, Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for, and hereby releases
              Landlord and Landlord’s Agents from responsibility for and waives its entire claim of recovery for any cost, loss or
              expense suffered or incurred by Tenant as a result of any damage to or destruction of the Premises, the Building or
              the Project or the repair or restoration thereof, including, without limitation, any cost, loss or expense resulting from
              any loss of use of the whole or any part of the Premises, the Building or the Project and/or any inconvenience or
              annoyance occasioned by such damage, repair or restoration.

                  (e) If Landlord is obligated to or elects to repair or restore as herein provided, Landlord shall repair or restore
              only the Tenant Improvements constructed by Tenant in the Premises pursuant to the terms of Exhibit B,
              substantially to their condition existing immediately prior to the occurrence of the damage or destruction; and
              Tenant shall promptly repair and restore, at Tenant’s expense, Tenant’s Alterations.



                   (f) Tenant hereby waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1932(2) and Section 1933(4) which
              permit termination of a lease upon destruction of the leased premises, and the provisions of any similar law now or
              hereinafter in effect, and the provisions of this Paragraph 21 shall govern exclusively in case of such destruction.

                   (g) If a fire or other casualty materially damages the Building, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of
              Landlord’s good faith estimate of the time required to repair or restore the Building. If Landlord estimates that repair
              or restoration of the Building cannot be completed within one (1) year following the date of the casualty, Tenant, at
              its option, may terminate this Lease. Tenant’s notice to Landlord of its election to so terminate this Lease must be
              delivered to Landlord within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s repair estimate. If Tenant timely
              delivers such notice to Landlord, this Lease shall terminate as of a date specified in Tenant’s termination notice,
              which date shall not be less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after such notice is given. Tenant shall
              have no right to terminate this Lease if Landlord fails to complete repairs or restoration within the time period
              estimated in good faith by Landlord, provided that Landlord shall diligently prosecute such repairs or restoration to
              completion.
