                                         the Premises and to conduct tests, monitoring and investigations. If such tests
                                         indicate the presence of any environmental condition caused or exacerbated by
                                         Tenant or any Tenant Party or arising during Tenant's or any Tenant Party's

                                         of performing work. The reimbursement shall be paid to Landlord in advance of
                                         Landlord's performing such work, based upon Landlord's reasonable estimate of
                                         the cost thereof; and upon completion of such work by Landlord, Tenant shall
                                         pay to Landlord any shortfall promptly after receipt of Landlord's bills therefor

                                         to Landlord) and hold harmless the Indemnitees from and against any and all
                                         Losses of or in connection with (1) Tenant and/or any Tenant Party's breach of
                                         this Section 15, or (2) the presence of Hazardous Materials on, under or about
                                         the Premises or other property as a result (directly or indirectly) of Tenant's
                                         and/or any Tenant Party's activities, or failure to act, in connection with the
                                         Premises. Landlord reserves the right to retain counsel for its defense, in which
                                         case Tenant shall be responsible for the cost of such defense. This indemnity
                                         shall include, without limitation, any Losses arising from or in connection with
                                         (i) the effects of any contamination or injury to person, property or the
                                         environment created or suffered by Tenant, (ii) the cost of any required or
                                         necessary repair, cleanup or detoxification, and the preparation and

                                         action is required or necessary prior to or following the termination of this
                                         Lease, (iii) lost profits, consequential damages, the cost of demolition or
                                         rebuilding any improvements on real property, interest, penalties and damages
                                         arising from claims brought by or on behalf of employees of Tenant (with
                                         respect to which Tenant waives any right to raise as a defense against Landlord
                                         any immunity to which it may be entitled under any industrial or worker’s

                                         attorneys, consultants, contractors, experts, laboratories, and all other costs
                                         incurred in connection with the investigation or remediation of such Hazardous
                                         Materials or violation of such Environmental Laws, and (v) diminution in the
                                         fair market value of the Project including without limitation any reduction in fair
                                         market rental value or life expectancy of the Project or the improvements located
                                         thereon or the restriction on the use of or adverse impact on the marketing of the
                                         Project or any portion thereof. Neither the written consent by Landlord to the
                                         presence of Hazardous Materials on, under or about the Premises, nor the strict
                                         compliance by Tenant with all Environmental Laws, shall excuse Tenant from
                                         Tenant's obligation of indemnification pursuant hereto. Tenant's obligations
                                         pursuant to the foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or termination
                                         of this Lease. Neither the written consent by Landlord to the presence of
                                         Hazardous Materials on, under or about the Premises, nor the strict compliance
                                         by Tenant with all Environmental Laws, shall excuse Tenant from Tenant's
                                         obligation of indemnification pursuant hereto. Tenant's obligations pursuant to
                                         the foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.

                                         following receipt by Tenant of a written request therefor from Landlord (which
                                         request shall not be made more often than annually), Tenant shall disclose to

                                         obligation under this Subparagraph shall include the requirement that Tenant
                                         update, execute and deliver to Landlord the Survey Form, as the same may be
                                         modified by Landlord from time to time.
