
              6.   LATE CHARGE
                   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease to the contrary, Tenant hereby acknowledges that late
              payment to Landlord of Rent, or other amounts due hereunder will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated
              by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. If any Rent or other sums due from
              Tenant are not received by Landlord or by Landlord’s designated agent within five (5) business days after their due
              date, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord a late charge equal to ten percent (10%) of such overdue amount, plus any
              costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant’s failure to pay Rent and/or other charges when
              due hereunder. Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that such late charges represent a fair and reasonable estimate of
              the cost that Landlord will incur by reason of Tenant’s late payment and shall not be construed as a penalty.
              Landlord’s acceptance of such late charges shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default with respect to such
              overdue amount or estop Landlord from exercising any of the other rights and remedies granted under this Lease.
                   Initials:        Landlord                                     Tenant



              7.   SECURITY DEPOSIT
                   Concurrently with Tenant’s execution of this Lease, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord the Security Deposit
              specified in the Basic Lease Information as security for the full and faithful performance of each and every term,
              covenant and condition of this Lease. Landlord may use, apply or retain the whole or any part of the Security
              Deposit as may be reasonably necessary (a) to remedy any Default by Tenant under this Lease, (b) to repair damage
              to the Premises caused by Tenant, (c) to clean the Premises upon termination of this Lease, (d) to reimburse
              Landlord for the payment of any amount which Landlord may reasonably spend or be required to spend by reason of
              Tenant’s Default, and (e) to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage which Landlord may suffer by reason
              of Tenant’s Default. Should Tenant faithfully and fully comply with all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this
              Lease, within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the Term, the Security Deposit or any balance thereof shall
              be returned to Tenant or, at the option of Landlord, to the last assignee of Tenant’s interest in this Lease. Landlord
              shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general funds and Tenant shall not be entitled to
              any interest on such deposit. If Landlord so uses or applies all or any portion of said deposit, within five (5) business
              days after written demand therefor Tenant shall deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient to restore the
              Security Deposit to the full extent of the above amount, and Tenant’s failure to do so shall be a default under this
              Lease. In the event Landlord transfers its interest in this Lease, Landlord shall transfer the then remaining amount of
              the Security Deposit to Landlord’s successor in interest, and thereafter Landlord shall have no further liability to
              Tenant with respect to such Security Deposit.

              8.   POSSESSION
                   (a) Tenant’s Right of Possession. Subject to Paragraph 8(b), Tenant shall be entitled to possession of the
              Premises upon commencement of the Term. In addition, Tenant shall have the right to enter the Premises prior to
              commencement of the Term as set forth in Exhibit B. Tenant’s entry into and possession of the Premises (or portions
              thereof) prior to the Commencement Date shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, except for
              the obligation to pay Rent.

                   (b) Delay in Delivering Possession. If for any reason whatsoever, Landlord cannot deliver possession of the
              Premises to Tenant on or before the Estimated Commencement Date, this Lease shall not be void or voidable, nor
              shall Landlord, or Landlord’s agents, advisors, employees, partners, shareholders, directors, invitees, independent
              contractors or Landlord’s Investment Advisors (as hereinafter defined) (collectively, “Landlord’s Agents”), be
              liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom. Tenant shall not be liable for Rent until Landlord
              delivers possession of the Premises to Tenant. The Expiration Date shall be extended by the same number of days
              that Tenant’s possession of the Premises was delayed beyond the Estimated Commencement Date.
