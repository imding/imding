22. CONDEMNATION
                    (a) If the Premises or any portion thereof is permanently taken for any public or quasi-public purpose by any
              lawful governmental power or authority, by exercise of the right of appropriation, inverse condemnation,
              condemnation or eminent domain, or sold to prevent such taking (each such event being referred to as a
              “Condemnation”), this Lease shall terminate as to the part so taken as of the date the condemning authority takes
              title or possession, whichever occurs first. If ten percent (10%) or more of the Building or twenty percent (20%) or
              more of the Parking Area is taken, Landlord or Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease as of the date the
              condemning authority takes title or possession, whichever occurs first. If either party elects to terminate this Lease
              as provided herein, such election shall be made by written notice to the other party given within thirty (30) days
              after the nature and extent of such Condemnation have been finally determined. If neither Landlord nor Tenant
              elects to terminate this Lease to the extent permitted above, Landlord shall promptly proceed to restore the Premises,
              to the extent of any Condemnation award received by Landlord, to substantially the same condition as existed prior
              to such Condemnation, allowing for the reasonable effects of such Condemnation, and a proportionate abatement
              shall be made to the Base Rent corresponding to the time during which, and to the portion of the floor area of the
              Building (adjusted for any increase thereto resulting from any reconstruction) of which, Tenant is deprived on
              account of such Condemnation and restoration. Except as expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence
              with respect to abatement of Base Rent, Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for, and hereby releases
              Landlord and Landlord’s Agents from responsibility for and waives its entire claim of recovery for any cost, loss or
              expense suffered or incurred by Tenant as a result of any Condemnation, whether permanent or temporary, or the
              repair or restoration of the Premises, the Building, the Parking Area, or the Project following such Condemnation,
              including, without limitation, any cost, loss or expense resulting from any loss of use of the whole or any part of the
              Premises, the Building, the Parking Area or the Project and/or any inconvenience or annoyance occasioned by such
              Condemnation, repair or restoration. The provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1265.130, which
              allows either party to petition the Superior Court to terminate this Lease



              in the event of a partial taking of the Premises, the Building or the Project or the parking areas for the Building or
              the Project, and any other applicable law now or hereafter enacted, are hereby waived by Tenant.

                   (b) Landlord shall be entitled to any and all compensation, damages, income, rent, awards, or any interest
              therein whatsoever which may be paid or made in connection with any Condemnation, and Tenant shall have no
              claim against Landlord for the value of any unexpired term of this Lease or otherwise; provided, however, that
              Tenant shall be entitled to receive any award separately allocated by the condemning authority to Tenant for Tenant’s
              relocation expenses or the value of Tenant’s Property (specifically excluding fixtures, Alterations and other
              components of the Premises which under this Lease or by law are or at the expiration of the Term will become the
              property of Landlord), provided that such award does not reduce any award otherwise allocable or payable to
              Landlord.
