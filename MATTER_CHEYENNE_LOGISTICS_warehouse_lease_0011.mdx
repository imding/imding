                                                Lease, Tenant shall not occupy or shall vacate the Premises whether or
                                                not Tenant is in monetary or other default under this Lease; provided,
                                                however, that Tenant's vacating of the Premises shall not constitute an
                                                Event of Default if, prior to vacating the Premises, Tenant has made





                                                   arrangements reasonably acceptable to Landlord to (1) ensure that
                                                   Tenant's insurance for the Premises will not be voided or cancelled with
                                                   respect to the Premises as a result of such vacancy, (2) ensure that the
                                                   Premises are secured and not subject to vandalism, and (3) ensure that
                                                   the Premises will be properly maintained after such vacation, including,

                                         18.1.5 There shall occur any assignment, subleasing or other transfer of
                                                Tenant's interest in or with respect to this Lease except as otherwise
                                                permitted in this Lease.

                                         18.1.6 Tenant breaches a particular provision hereof (other than a provision
                                                requiring payment of Rent) and such failure shall continue for a period
                                                of three (3) days after receipt of written notice to Tenant on three (3)
                                                separate occasions during any twelve (12)-month period, and in such
                                                event, Tenant’s subsequent breach of such provision shall be, at
                                                Landlord’s option, an incurable Event of Default.

                                                those specifically referred to in this Section 18.1, and except as
                                                otherwise expressly provided herein, such default shall continue for
                                                more than thirty (30) days after Landlord shall have given Tenant
                                                written notice of such default.

                                         shall be cumulative and nonexclusive), the option to pursue any one or more of
                                         the following remedies (which shall be cumulative and nonexclusive) without
                                         any notice or demand subject to Landlord’s obligations to mitigate damages
                                         and/or Losses, as outlined in the Lease:
                                         18.2.1 Landlord may terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall
                                                immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails to
                                                do so, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy it may have
                                                for possession or arrearages in Rent, enter upon and take possession of
                                                the Premises and expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may
                                                be occupying the Premises or any part thereof, without being liable for
                                                prosecution or any claim of damages therefor other than for negligence
                                                and willful misconduct of Landlord, its agents and/or contractors; and
                                                Landlord may recover from Tenant the following: (a) the worth at the
                                                time of award of the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of
                                                such termination; (b) the worth at the time of award of the amount by
                                                which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination
                                                until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
                                                Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (c) the worth at the
                                                time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of
                                                the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such Rent loss
                                                that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; (d) any other amount
                                                necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately
                                                caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations hereunder or which
                                                in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom,
                                                including brokerage commissions, advertising expenses, expenses of
                                                restore any portion of the Premises back to its original condition as of
                                                the Commencement Date (subject to normal wear and tear)(“Costs of
                                                Reletting”); plus (e) at Landlord’s option, such other amounts in
                                                addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to
                                                time by law. As used in subsection (a) and subsection (b) above, the
                                                “worth at the time of award” shall be computed by allowing interest at
                                                a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the annual “Bank Prime Loan”

                                                   the Applicable Interest Rate. As used in subsection (c) above, the
                                                   “worth at the time of award” shall be computed by discounting such
                                                   amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San

                                         18.2.2 If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease on account of any
                                                Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord may, from time to time, without
                                                terminating this Lease, terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the
                                                Premises and, in compliance with Applicable Laws, remove Tenant,
                                                Tenant’s property and any parties occupying the Premises. Landlord will
                                                use commercially reasonable efforts to relet all or any part of the
                                                Premises, without notice to Tenant, for such period of time and on such
                                                terms and conditions (which may include concessions, free rent and
                                                work allowances) as Landlord shall reasonably determine. Landlord may
                                                collect and receive all rents and other income from the

                                                   reletting. Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand all past due Rent, all
                                                   Costs of Reletting and any deficiency arising from the reletting or failure
                                                   to relet the Premises. The re-entry or taking of possession of the
                                                   Premises shall not be construed as an election by Landlord to terminate
                                                   this Lease.

                                         18.2.3 Landlord shall at all times have the rights and remedies (which shall be
                                                cumulative with each other and cumulative and in addition to those
                                                rights and remedies available under Section 18.2.1 and Section 18.2.2,
                                                or any law or other provision hereof), without prior demand or notice
                                                except as required by law, to seek any declaratory, injunctive or other
                                                equitable relief, and specifically enforce this Lease, or restrain or enjoin
                                                a violation or breach of any provision hereof.
                                         18.2.4 Unless Landlord provides Tenant with express notice to the contrary, no

                                                reletting, appointment of a receiver or other action or omission by
                                                Landlord shall (a) be construed as an election by Landlord to terminate
                                                this Lease or Tenant’s right to possession, or to accept a surrender of the
                                                Premises, or (b) operate to release Tenant from any of its obligations
                                                hereunder.
                                         18.2.5 If Landlord elects to cure such Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord
                                                may, at Landlord's option, enter into and upon the Premises and correct
                                                the same without being deemed in any manner guilty of trespass,
                                                eviction or forcible entry and detainer and without incurring any liability
                                                for any damage or interruption of Tenant's business resulting therefrom.
                                                If any lien is filed and not cured within the fifteen (15) day time period
                                                set forth above, then Landlord may take such action as may be necessary
                                                to remove such lien. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord an amount equal to
                                                one hundred ten percent (110%) of any expenses which Landlord may
                                                incur in thus effecting compliance with Tenant's obligations under this
                                                Lease, including without limitation, attorney’s fees, together with
                                                interest thereon at the Applicable Interest Rate from the date of
                                                expenditure.

                                         18.2.6 Exercise by Landlord of any one (1) or more remedies hereunder
                                                granted or otherwise available shall not be deemed to be an acceptance
                                                of surrender of the Premises and/or a termination of this Lease by
                                                Landlord, whether by agreement or by operation of law, it being
                                                understood that except as provided in Section 18.2.1 and Section 18.2.2
                                                above, such surrender and/or termination can be effected only by the
                                                written agreement of Landlord and Tenant. Any law, usage, or custom to
                                                the contrary notwithstanding, Landlord shall have the right at all times
                                                to enforce the provisions of this Lease in strict accordance with the
                                                terms hereof; and the failure of Landlord at any time to enforce its rights

                                                   as having created a custom in any way or manner contrary to the specific
                                                   terms, provisions, and covenants of this Lease or as having modified the
                                                   same. Tenant and Landlord further agree that forbearance or waiver by
                                                   Landlord to enforce its rights pursuant to this Lease or at law or in
                                                   equity, shall not be a waiver of Landlord's right to enforce one (1) or
                                                   more of its rights in connection with any subsequent Event of Default. A

                                                   breach of any covenant hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such
                                                   breach, and no waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease shall
                                                   be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by
