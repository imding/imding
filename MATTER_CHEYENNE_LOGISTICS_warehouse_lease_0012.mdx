                     19.       ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.
                               19.1      Except as permitted under this Article 19, Tenant shall not assign, sublet,
                                         convey, mortgage, license or otherwise transfer (any of the foregoing, a
                                         “Transfer”), whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law, the
                                         Premises or any part thereof without Landlord's prior written approval, which
                                         shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. A “Permitted
                                         Transfer” shall be deemed to mean: (i) the merger of Tenant with any other
                                         entity or the indirect or direct transfer of any controlling or managing ownership
                                         or beneficial interest in Tenant, and (ii) the assignment or transfer of a
                                         substantial portion of the assets of Tenant, whether or not located at the
                                         Premises. If Tenant desires to undertake a Transfer, Tenant shall give Landlord
                                         prior written notice thereof with copies of all related documents and agreements
                                         associated with the Transfer, including without limitation, the financial
                                         statements of any proposed assignee, subtenant or transferee, at least fifteen (15)
                                         days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Transfer. Tenant shall pay
                                         Landlord's reasonable attorneys' and financial consultant's fees incurred in the
                                         review of such documentation whether or not a Transfer is consummated or
                                         approval is granted, not to exceed $500 per occurrence. If Landlord fails to
                                         notify Tenant in writing of Landlord’s approval or disapproval of any proposed
                                         Transfer within fifteen (15) business days after Landlord’s receipt of all required
                                         documentation, Landlord shall be deemed to have approved such Transfer. If
                                         Landlord approves of such Transfer, the parties shall enter into a consent
                                         agreement in a form reasonably designated by Landlord, and in the case of an
                                         assignment, the assignee shall assume in writing, for Landlord’s benefit, all of
                                         Tenant’s obligations hereunder. Any purported Transfer contrary to the
                                         provisions hereof shall be void and constitute an Event of Default. This Lease
                                         may not be assigned by operation of law. In the event of an assignment of this
                                         Lease or subletting of all of the Rentable Square Footage of the Premises for the
                                         remaining Term (excluding unexercised options), Landlord shall have the right
                                         to recapture the portion of the Premises that Tenant is proposing to assign or
                                         sublease. If Landlord exercises its right to recapture, this Lease shall
                                         automatically be terminated with respect to the Premises effective on the
                                         proposed effective date of the Transfer, although Landlord may require Tenant to
                                         execute a reasonable amendment or other document reflecting such termination.
                                         If Tenant receives rent or other consideration for any such Transfer in excess of
                                         the Rent, or in the case of a sublease of a portion of the Premises, in excess of
                                         such Rent that is fairly allocable to such portion, after appropriate adjustments to
                                         assure that all other payments required hereunder are appropriately taken into
                                         account, Tenant shall pay Landlord fifty percent (50%) of the difference between
                                         each such payment of rent or other consideration and the Rent required





                                         hereunder, after Tenant's recovery of its actual and reasonable attorney's fees,
                                         brokerage commissions and improvement allowances, improvement costs or
                                         other concessions incurred directly in connection with such assignment or
                                         subletting, determined on a straight-line basis. Subject to Landlord exercising its
                                         right to recapture the Premises, Tenant shall continue to be liable as a principal
                                         and not as a guarantor or surety to the same extent as though no assignment had
                                         been made, and in no event shall any assignment or other Transfer release or
                                         relieve Tenant from any obligation under this Lease. Tenant shall not collaterally
                                         assign, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber this Lease or any
                                         of Tenant's rights hereunder without the prior written consent of Landlord, which
                                         consent Landlord may withhold in its sole discretion.

                               19.2      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 19, neither
                                         Tenant nor any other person having a right to possess, use, or occupy (for
                                         convenience, collectively referred to in this subsection as “Use”) the Premises
                                         shall enter into any lease, sublease, license, concession or other agreement for
                                         Use of all or any portion of the Premises which provides for rental or other
                                         payment for such Use based, in whole or in part, on the net income or profits
                                         derived by any person that leases, possesses, uses, or occupies all or any portion
                                         of the Premises

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                            23




                                         (other than an amount based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or
                                         sales), and any such purported lease, sublease, license, concession or other
                                         agreement shall be absolutely void and ineffective as a Transfer of any right or
                                         interest in the Use of all or any part of the Premises.
                               19.3      Notwithstanding anything in this Article 19 to the contrary, provided no Event
                                         of Default exists or is continuing under this Lease, Tenant may, without
                                         Landlord's consent, but after providing written notice to Landlord pursuant to the
                                         notice provision of Section 19.1, assign this Lease or sublet all or any portion of
                                         the Premises to any Related Entity (as herein defined) provided that (i) such
                                         Related Entity is not a governmental entity or agency; (ii) such Related Entity's
                                         use of the Premises would not cause Landlord to be in violation of any
                                         exclusivity agreement within the Project; and (iii) such Related Entity provides
                                         evidence of its credit worthiness and financial stability to maintain the financial
                                         obligations under the Lease with proof satisfactory to Landlord, determined in
                                         its reasonable discretion, of such sufficient net worth having been delivered to
                                         Landlord at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such transaction.
                                         "Related Entity" shall be defined as any parent company, subsidiary, affiliate or
                                         related corporate entity of Tenant that controls, is controlled by, or is under
                                         common control with Tenant.
                               19.4      Notwithstanding anything in this Article 19 to the contrary, provided no Event
                                         of Default exists or is continuing under this Lease, Tenant may, without
                                         Landlord's consent, but after providing written notice to Landlord pursuant to the
                                         notice provision in Section 19.1, assign this Lease or sublet all or any portion of
                                         the Premises in connection with a Permitted Transfer provided that (i) such
                                         Related Entity is not a governmental entity or agency; (ii) such Related Entity's
                                         use of the Premises would not cause Landlord to be in violation of any
                                         exclusivity agreement within the Project; and (iii) the net worth (computed in
                                         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles exclusive of goodwill)
                                         of any assignee after such transfer is greater than or equal to the greater of (a)
                                         the net worth of Tenant as of the Effective Date; or (b) the net worth standards of
                                         Tenant immediately after such transfer are acceptable to Landlord in its
                                         reasonable determination with evidence of such net worth delivered to Landlord
                                         at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of such transfer.
