              15.   Eligibility Period:          One day’s Rent for each one (1) hour period (or part thereof) during which an Interruption
                                                 of Landlord’s Service has occurred and is continuing, up to a maximum of three (3) days’

                                                 For example:
                                                 (a) if such Interruption of Landlord’s Service continues for one (1) minute, one (1) day’s
                                                 Rent shall be abated;

                                                 (b) if such Interruption of Landlord’s Service continues for a consecutive period of sixty

                                                 (c) if such Interruption of Landlord’s Service continues for a consecutive period of one-
                                                 hundred twenty (120) minutes, one (1) additional day’s Rent shall be abated; and

                                                 (d) if such Interruption of Landlord’s Service continues for a consecutive period of twenty-
                                                 four (24) hours and one minute (and for each period of twenty-four (24) hours thereafter
                                                 during which such Interruption of Landlord’s Service continues – whether such Interruption
                                                 of Landlord’s Service is continuous, or whether there are brief periods of service followed
                                                 by further interruptions related to the same initial root cause (i.e., a specific PDU has
                                                 become inoperable, or a specific CRAC unit has become inoperable) [all such subsequent
                                                 Interruption of Landlord’s Service are deemed to be the “Same Interruption”]), one (1)
                                                 additional day’s Rent shall be abated for each of the first (1st) three (3) hours of each
                                                 successive twenty-

                                                                            -v-





                                                 four (24) hour period of the Same Interruption.

                                                 The maximum Rent abatement for any twenty-four (24) hour period during which an
                                                 Interruption of Landlord’s Service occurs, regardless of the number or length of
                                                 Interruption of Landlord’s Service stemming from the Same Interruption in such twenty-
                                                 four (24) hour period, shall not exceed three (3) days’ Rent, in accordance with (a)-(d),
                                                 above.

                                                 The foregoing notwithstanding, Interruption of Landlord’s Service that are not the “Same
                                                 Interruption” shall entitle Tenant to the abatement rights described above with regard to
                                                 each Independent Interruption (defined below).

                                                 For example: if (aa) a specific PDU becomes inoperable due to an internal electrical
                                                 malfunction, causing some or all of Tenant’s operations to lose power, and (bb) a specific
                                                 CRAC unit becomes inoperable due to a lack of the necessary cooling agent, causing a rise
                                                 in the temperature of the Premises above that which is described in Item 4(a) of Exhibit
                                                 “F”, such that Tenant cuts power to its operating equipment in order to protect such
                                                 equipment from the effects of high temperatures (and such lack of cooling agent is not
                                                 directly caused by the inoperable PDU), then (aa) and (bb) would be considered
                                                 “Independent Interruptions”.
