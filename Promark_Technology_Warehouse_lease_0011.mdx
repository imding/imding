24. **PARKING.** Tenant shall be entitled to the reasonable use of open and non-reserved non-exclusive parking spaces together with Landlord with respect to any parking areas located in the Total Property. Tenant shall be liable for all vehicles owned, rented or used by Tenant or Tenant’s agents and invitees in or about the Total Property. Any equipment, inventory or other property stored in any trucks shall be stored at Tenant’s sole risk. Tenant shall not store any trucks on the passenger car parking lot of the Total Property. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, in the event the Premises have access to a loading dock which exclusively services the Premises, and no other space, Tenant may store one or more of its vehicles in such dock area, provided such storage does not restrict truck access or maneuverability for any other tenant or person to or from any other loading dock servicing the Total Property. In the event the Premises have access to a loading dock which does not exclusively service the Premises, Tenant shall not park its trucks in the dock area longer than the time it takes to reasonably load or unload its trucks. In no event shall Tenant park any vehicle in or about a loading dock which exclusively services another tenant or occupant within the Total Property or in a thoroughfare, driveway, street or other area not specifically designated for parking. Landlord reserves the right to establish uniform rules and regulations for the loading and unloading of trucks upon the Total Property, which rules may include the right to designate specific parking spaces for tenants’ use. Upon request by Landlord, Tenant shall move its trucks and vehicles if, in Landlord’s reasonable opinion, said vehicles are in violation of any of the above restrictions. Landlord also reserves the right to order reasonable changes to the location and size of any parking areas located in the Total Property.
