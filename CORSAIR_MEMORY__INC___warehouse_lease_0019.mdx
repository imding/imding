33. NOTICES
                   All notices and demands which are required or may be permitted to be given to either party by the other
              hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sent by United States mail, postage prepaid, certified, or by personal
              delivery or nationally recognized overnight courier, addressed to the addressee at Tenant’s Address or Landlord’s
              Address as specified in the Basic Lease Information, or to such other place as either party may from time to time
              designate in a notice to


              the other party given as provided herein. Copies of all notices and demands given to Landlord shall additionally be
              sent to Landlord’s property manager at the address specified in the Basic Lease Information or at such other address
              as Landlord may specify in writing from time to time. Notice shall be deemed given upon actual receipt (or
              attempted delivery if delivery is refused), if personally delivered, or one (1) business day following deposit with a
              reputable overnight courier that provides a receipt, or on the third (3rd) day following deposit in the United States
              mail in the manner described above.

              34. WAIVER
                   The waiver of any breach of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease shall not be deemed to be a waiver of
              such term, covenant or condition or of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant or condition
              herein contained. The subsequent acceptance of Rent by Landlord shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any
              preceding breach by Tenant, other than the failure of Tenant to pay the particular rental so accepted, regardless of
              Landlord’s knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such Rent. No delay or omission in the
              exercise of any right or remedy of Landlord in regard to any Default by Tenant shall impair such a right or remedy
              or be construed as a waiver. Any waiver by Landlord of any Default must be in writing and shall not be a waiver of
              any other Default concerning the same or any other provisions of this Lease.

              35. HOLDING OVER
                   Any holding over after the expiration of the Term, without the express written consent of Landlord, shall
              constitute a Default and, without limiting Landlord’s remedies provided in this Lease, such holding over shall be
              construed to be a tenancy at sufferance, at a rental rate equal to the greater of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of
              the fair market rental value for the Premises as reasonably determined by Landlord or two hundred percent
              (200%) of the Base Rent last due in this Lease, plus Additional Rent, and shall otherwise be on the terms and
              conditions herein specified, so far as applicable; provided, however, in no event shall any renewal or expansion
              option or other similar right or option contained in this Lease be deemed applicable to any such tenancy at
              sufferance. If the Premises are not surrendered at the end of the Term or sooner termination of this Lease, and in
              accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 11 and 32(h), Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord
              harmless from and against any and all loss or liability resulting from delay by Tenant in so surrendering the Premises
              including, without limitation, any loss or liability resulting from any claim against Landlord made by any
              succeeding tenant or prospective tenant founded on or resulting from such delay and losses to Landlord due to lost
              opportunities to lease any portion of the Premises to any such succeeding tenant or prospective tenant, together with,
              in each case, actual attorneys’ fees and costs.

              36. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS
                  The terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease shall, subject to the provisions as to assignment, apply to and
              bind the heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns of all of the parties hereto. If Tenant shall consist of
              more than one entity or person, the obligations of Tenant under this Lease shall be joint and several.
