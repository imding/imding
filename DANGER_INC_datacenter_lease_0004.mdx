
                   3. BASE RENT AND OTHER CHARGES.
                    3.1 Base Rent. Commencing on the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord base rent (the “Base Rent”) for
              the Tenant Space in the amount set forth in Item 9 of the Basic Lease Information. All such Base Rent shall be paid to Landlord
              in equal monthly installments in advance on the first day of each and every month throughout the Term of this Lease; provided,
              however, that (a) the first full monthly installment of Base Rent shall be payable upon Tenant’s execution of this Lease and
              (b) if the Term of this Lease does not commence on the first day of a calendar month, the Base Rent for such partial calendar
              month shall (i) be calculated on a per diem basis determined by dividing the Base Rent above by the actual number of days in
              such month and multiplying such amount by the number of days remaining in such calendar month from and after (and
              including) the Commencement Date, and (ii) shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on the Commencement Date. Except as set
              forth in this Section 3.1, Tenant shall not pay any installment of Rent (defined in Section 3.3, below) more than one (1) month
              in advance.

                   3.2 Installation Fee/Other Charges. In addition to paying the Base Rent, within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s receipt of
              an invoice therefor from Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent the one-time installation fee and any other
              charges specified in Item 10 of the Basic Lease Information as partial consideration for the fixturization of the Datacenter as set
              forth on Exhibit “E” attached hereto and Landlord’s costs in connection with this Lease and Tenant’s commencement of
              operations within the Tenant Space

                   3.3 Payments Generally. Base Rent, all forms of Additional Rent (defined in this Section 3.3, below) payable hereunder
              by Tenant and all other amounts, fees, payments or charges payable hereunder by Tenant shall (i) each constitute rent payable
              hereunder (and shall sometimes collectively be referred to herein as “Rent”), (ii) be payable to Landlord when due without any
              prior notice or demand therefor (except as provided herein) in lawful money of the United States without any abatement, offset
              or

                                                                              -3-





              deduction whatsoever (except as specifically provided otherwise herein), and (iii) be payable to Landlord at the address of
              Landlord specified in Item 17 of the Basic Lease Information (or to such other person or to such other place as Landlord may
              from time to time designate in writing to Tenant. No receipt of money by Landlord from Tenant after the termination of this
              Lease, the service of any notice, the commencement of any suit, or a final judgment for possession shall reinstate, continue or
              extend the Term of this Lease or affect any such notice, demand, suit or judgment. No partial payment by Tenant shall be
              deemed to be other than on account of the full amount otherwise due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or
              any letter accompanying any check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord shall be entitled to accept
              such payment without compromise or prejudice to any of the rights of Landlord hereunder or under any Applicable Laws
              (defined in Section 6.3.1, below). In the event that the Commencement Date or the Expiration Date (or the date of any earlier
              termination of this Lease) falls on a date other than the first or last day of a calendar month, respectively, the Rent payable for
              such partial calendar month shall be prorated based on a per diem basis. For purposes of this Lease, all amounts (other than
              Base Rent) payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to this Lease, whether or not denominated as such, shall constitute
              “Additional Rent.” All Rent payable hereunder, except for Base Rent and except as otherwise specifically set forth herein,
              shall be payable in arrears within thirty (30) day of invoice by Landlord.

                    3.4 Late Payments. Tenant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Base Rent or
              Additional Rent (or any other sums due hereunder) will cause Landlord to incur administrative costs not contemplated under
              this Lease and other damages, the exact amount of which would be extremely difficult or impractical to fix. Landlord and
              Tenant agree that if Landlord does not receive any such payment on or before the date that is five (5) days after the date on
              which such payment is due (a “Late Charge Delinquency”), Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, (i) a late charge
              (“Late Charge”) equal to five percent (5%) of the amount overdue to cover such additional administrative costs and damages,
              and (ii) interest on all such delinquent amounts at an interest rate (the “Default Rate”) equal to the lesser of (a) one and one-
              half percent (1 1/2 %) per month or (b) the maximum lawful rate from the date such amounts are first delinquent until the date
              the same are paid. In no event, however, shall the charges permitted under this Article 3 or elsewhere in this Lease, to the extent
              the same are considered to be interest under applicable law, exceed the maximum lawful rate of interest. Landlord’s acceptance
              of any Late Charge, or interest pursuant to this Section 3.4, shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default with
              respect to the overdue amount, nor prevent Landlord from exercising any of the other rights and remedies available to Landlord
              hereunder or under any Applicable Laws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord agrees to waive the default
              interest and late charges for one (1) late payment hereunder during any consecutive twelve (12) calendar month period during
              the Term provided such late payment is paid in full within five (5) business days after written notice to Tenant of such failure.

                    3.5 Electrical Power. Tenant shall pay for all electricity provided to and/or used in the Tenant Space, as set forth herein.
              An electrical metering device (or electrical metering devices) (collectively, the “Electrical Metering Equipment”) compatible
              with Landlord’s energy management system for monitoring electricity provided to and/or used in the Tenant Space shall be
              installed by Tenant at Tenant’s cost. Landlord shall bill Tenant monthly for the actual cost of all electricity provided to and/or
              used in the Tenant Space based upon the Electrical Metering Equipment (the “Actual Electrical Costs”), plus a cost-recovery
              factor equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Actual Electrical Costs (the “Shared Electrical Payment”; together with the Actual
              Electrical Costs, collectively, the “Power Payment”). Tenant shall pay the Power Payment to Landlord, as Additional Rent,
              within thirty (30) days of delivery of such Power Payment invoice. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that the Shared Electrical
              Payment is intended to reimburse Landlord for electricity used by certain equipment within the Tenant Space and/or by
              equipment located outside the Tenant Space but serving the Tenant Space, which usage, in either case, is commercially
              impractical of being metered because it utilizes equipment and/or facilities designed to serve more area of the Building than
              just the Tenant Space (the “Shared Electrical Equipment”). For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intent of the parties that this
              Section 3.5 represents a mechanism only for Landlord’s cost recovery with regard to electrical power provided to and/or used
              in or for the Tenant Space, and that there is no intent for Tenant’s Power Payment to include any element of profit to the
              Landlord in connection therewith.

                                                                               -4-





              4. TAX ON TENANT’S EQUIPMENT; OTHER TAXES.
                    4.1 Equipment Taxes. Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay at least ten (10) days before delinquency (and Tenant
              hereby indemnifies and holds Landlord harmless from and against any Claims (defined in Section 14.2, below) arising out of,
              in connection with, or in any manner related to) all governmental fees, taxes, tariffs and other charges levied directly or
              indirectly against any personal property, fixtures, machinery, equipment, apparatus, systems, connections, interconnections and
              appurtenances located in or used by Tenant in or in connection with the Tenant Space. If any such taxes for which Tenant is
              liable are levied or assessed against Landlord or Landlord’s property, and if Landlord elects to pay the same, Tenant shall pay to
              Landlord as Additional Rent, within ten (10) days of Landlord’s demand therefor, that part of such taxes for which Tenant is
              liable hereunder.

                   4.2 Additional Taxes. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent and within ten (10) days of Landlord’s demand
              therefor, and in such manner and at such times as Landlord shall direct from time to time by written notice to Tenant, any
              excise, sales, privilege, margin or other tax, assessment or other charge imposed, assessed or levied by any governmental or
              quasi-governmental authority or agency upon Landlord on account of (i) the Rent (and other amounts) payable by Tenant
              hereunder (or any other benefit received by Landlord hereunder), including, without limitation, any gross receipts tax, license
              fee or excise tax levied by any governmental authority, (ii) this Lease, Landlord’s business as a lessor hereunder, and the
              possession, leasing, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy of any portion of the Tenant
              Space (including, without limitation, any applicable possessory interest taxes), (iii) this transaction or any document to which
              Tenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Tenant Space, or (iv) otherwise in respect of or as a result
              of the agreement or relationship of Landlord and Tenant hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be
              responsible for the payment of any federal and state income taxes, franchise taxes, excess profits taxes gift taxes, capital stock
              taxes, inheritance and succession taxes, estate taxes, and other taxes applied or measured by Landlord’s general or net income
              (as opposed to taxes applied or measured by Landlord’s rents, receipts, or income attributable to operations at the Building
              and/or taxes that are commonly referred to as “margin” taxes or “net profits” taxes).

              5. SECURITY DEPOSIT; LETTER OF CREDIT.
                    5.1 In the event that Tenant elects to deposit the amount specified in Item 11 of the Basic Lease Information as a security
              deposit (the “Security Deposit”), the provisions of this Section 5.1 shall apply to the Security Deposit. Landlord shall hold the
              Security Deposit as security for the performance by Tenant of Tenant’s covenants and obligations under this Lease, it being
              expressly understood and agreed that the Security Deposit shall not be considered an advance payment of Rent or a measure of
              Landlord’s damages in case of default by Tenant. The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord without liability to Tenant for
              interest, and Landlord may commingle such deposit with any other funds held by Landlord. Upon the occurrence of any Event
              of Default (defined in Section 15.1 below), Landlord may, from time to time, without prejudice to any other remedy, apply the
              Security Deposit to the extent necessary to make good any arrears of Base Rent, Additional Rent, and any other payment,
              damage, injury, expense or liability caused to Landlord by such Event of Default. Following any application of the Security
              Deposit, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the amount so applied in order to restore the Security Deposit to the amount
              thereof immediately prior to such application. Subject to the requirements of, and conditions imposed by, governmental laws,
              rules and regulations applicable to security deposits under commercial leases (the “Applicable Security Deposit Laws”),
              Landlord shall, within the time required by Applicable Security Deposit Laws, or if no such requirement, within sixty (60) days
              after the expiration of the Term of this Lease (or the earlier termination of this Lease), return to Tenant the portion (if any) of
              the Security Deposit remaining after deducting all damages, charges and other amounts owing by Tenant to Landlord under this
              Lease. Landlord and Tenant agree that such deductions shall include, without limitation, all damages and losses that Landlord
              has suffered or that Landlord reasonably estimates that it will suffer as a result of any default under this Lease by Tenant. If
              Landlord transfers Landlord’s interest in the Tenant Space during the Term of this Lease (including any extension thereof),
              Landlord may assign the Security Deposit to the transferee, and upon such transfer and the delivery to Tenant of an
              acknowledgement of the

                                                                                -5-





              transferee’s responsibility for the Security Deposit, Landlord shall have no further liability for the return of the Security
              Deposit. In the event the provisions of any Applicable Security Deposit Laws, or other provisions of Law, now or hereinafter in
              force, which restricts the amount or types of claims that a landlord may make upon a security deposit or imposes upon a
              landlord (or its successors) any obligation with respect to the handling or return of security deposits, conflict with the terms and
              conditions of this Section 5, the terms and conditions of this Section 5 shall govern.
