             17. MISCELLANEOUS.
                   17.1 Severability. If any provision of this Lease is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
              invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby.

                   17.2 Performance. The covenants and obligations of Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall be independent of
              performance by Landlord of the covenants and obligations of Landlord pursuant to this Lease. Tenant’s performance
              of each of its obligations under this Lease shall be a condition precedent to the duty of Landlord to perform its
              obligations hereunder.

                    17.3 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. If either Landlord or Tenant initiates any litigation, mediation, arbitration or
              other proceeding regarding the enforcement, construction or interpretation of this Lease, then the non-prevailing
              party shall pay the prevailing party’s attorneys’ fees and costs (including, without limitation, all expense
              reimbursements, expert witness fees and litigation costs). In addition, if it should otherwise be necessary or proper
              for Landlord to consult an attorney (in good faith) concerning this Lease (specifically, for the review of instruments
              evidencing a proposed Transfer or for the purpose of collecting delinquent Rent), Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord
              its actual attorneys’ fees whether suit be brought or not to the extent such fees exceed $500.00.

                 17.4 Waiver of Right to Jury Trial. IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE COST OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTES
              BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS
              LEASE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LANDLORD AND TENANT EACH
              EXPRESSLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY TRIAL HELD AS A RESULT OF A CLAIM
              ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR IN ANY MANNER RELATED TO THIS LEASE IN WHICH
              LANDLORD AND TENANT ARE ADVERSE PARTIES. THE FILING OF A CROSS-COMPLAINT BY ONE
              AGAINST THE OTHER IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE PARTIES “ADVERSE.”

                   17.5 Headings; Time; Survival. The headings of the Articles, Sections and Exhibits of this Lease are for
              convenience only and do not define, limit or construe the contents thereof. Words of any gender used in this Lease
              shall be held and construed to include any other gender, and words in the singular number shall be held to include
              the plural, unless the context otherwise requires. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has read and
              reviewed this Lease and that it has had the opportunity to confer with counsel in the negotiation of this Lease.
              Accordingly, this Lease shall be construed neither for nor against Landlord or Tenant, but shall be given a fair and
              reasonable interpretation in accordance with the meaning of its terms and the intent of the parties. In all instances
              where Tenant is required to pay any sum or do any act at a particular indicated time or within an indicated period, it
              is understood that time

                                                                           -26-
                                                                 Data Center Lease




              is of the essence. Any obligations of Tenant accruing prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease shall survive
              the expiration or termination of this Lease, and Tenant shall promptly perform all such obligations whether or not
              this Lease has expired.

                   17.6 Notices. Any notice which may or shall be given under the provisions of this Lease shall be in writing and
              may be delivered by (i) by hand delivery or personal service, (ii) by a reputable overnight courier service which
              provides evidence of delivery, or (iii) by telecopy (so long as a confirming copy is forwarded by a reputable
              overnight courier service within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), if for Landlord, to the address specified in
              Item 16 of the Basic Lease Information, or if for Tenant, at the address specified in Item 3 of the Basic Lease
              Provisions, or at such other addresses as either party may have theretofore specified by written notice delivered in
              accordance herewith. Such address may be changed from time to time by either party by giving notice as provided
              herein. Notice shall be deemed given, (a) when delivered (if delivered by hand or personal service), (b) if sent by a
              reputable overnight courier service, on the business day immediately following the business day on which it was
              sent, or (c) the date the telecopy is transmitted.

                   17.7 Governing Law; No Counterclaim; Jurisdiction. This Lease shall be governed by, and construed in
              accordance with, the laws of the state in which the Property is located. It is mutually agreed that in the event
              Landlord commences any summary proceeding for non-payment of Rent, Tenant will not interpose any counterclaim
              (other than any compulsory counterclaims) of whatever nature or description in any such proceeding. The foregoing
              shall not be construed to prevent Tenant from bringing a separate action related to such counterclaims. In addition,
              Tenant hereby submits to local jurisdiction in the state in which the Property is located and agrees that any action by
              Tenant against Landlord shall be instituted in the state in which the Property is located and that Landlord shall have
              personal jurisdiction over Tenant for any action brought by Landlord against Tenant in the state in which the
              Property is located.

                   17.8 Incorporation; Amendment; Merger. This Lease, along with any exhibits and attachments or other
              documents referred to herein, all of which are hereby incorporated into this Lease by this reference, constitutes the
              entire and exclusive agreement between Landlord and Tenant relating to the Tenant Space, and each of the
              aforementioned documents may be altered, amended or revoked only by an instrument in writing signed by the party
              to be charged thereby. All prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, understandings and/or practices relative to the
              leasing or use of the Tenant Space are merged herein or revoked hereby.

                    17.9 Brokers. Each party hereto represents to the other that the representing party has not engaged, dealt with
              or been represented by any broker in connection with this Lease other than the brokers specified in Item 18 of the
              Basic Lease Information. Landlord and Tenant shall each indemnify, defend (with legal counsel reasonably
              acceptable to the other) and hold harmless the other party from and against all Claims (including attorneys’ fees and
              all litigation expenses) related to any claim made by any other person or entity for any commission or other
              compensation in connection with the execution of this Lease or the leasing of the Tenant Space to Tenant (other than
              the Commission Agreement (defined hereinafter)) if based on an allegation that claimant dealt through the
              indemnifying party. The provisions of this Section 17.9 shall survive the termination of this Lease. Landlord shall
              pay Tenant’s Broker a commission of up to One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) pursuant to a separate
              agreement (the “Commission Agreement”) and hereby indemnifies and holds Tenant harmless for all Claims
              (including attorney’s fees and all litigation expenses) arising or relating to Landlord’s failure to pay Tenant’s Broker
              the commission that Tenant’s Broker is due under the Commission Agreement not to exceed $1,000,000.00.
              Additionally, Tenant hereby indemnifies and holds Landlord harmless for all Claims (including attorney’s fees and
              all litigation expenses) arising or relating to any commission that Tenant’s Broker is due in connection with any
              agreement with Tenant, pursuant to which Tenant’s Broker is due a commission, related to this Lease, in excess of an
              aggregate amount of $1,000,000.00.

                                                                           -27-
                                                                Data Center Lease




                  17.10 Examination of Lease. This Lease shall not be binding or effective until each of the parties hereto have
              executed and delivered an original or counterpart hereof to each other.

                  17.11 Recordation. Neither Tenant nor any person or entity acting through, under or on behalf of Tenant shall
              record or cause the recordation of this Lease, a short form memorandum of this Lease or any reference to this Lease.

                    17.12 Authority. The persons executing this Lease on behalf of Landlord and Tenant represent to the other
              party that they are duly authorized to execute and deliver this Lease pursuant to their respective by-laws, operating
              agreement, resolution or other legally sufficient authority. Further, each party and the persons executing this Lease
              on their behalf represent to the other party that (i) if it is a partnership, the undersigned are all of its general partners,
              (ii) it has been validly formed or incorporated, (iii) it is duly qualified to do business in the state in which the
              Property is located, and (iv) this Lease is being executed on its behalf and for its benefit.

                   17.13 Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, all of the covenants, conditions and
              provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
              heirs, personal representatives and permitted successors and assigns.

                   17.14 Force Majeure. A party shall incur no liability to the other party with respect to, and shall not be
              responsible for any failure to perform, any of its obligations hereunder (other than payment obligations or
              obligations that may be cured by the payment of money (e.g., maintaining insurance)) if such failure is caused by
              any reason beyond the control of the party obligated to perform such obligations, including, but not limited to,
              strike, labor trouble, governmental rule, regulations, ordinance, statute or interpretation, or by fire, earthquake, civil
              commotion, or failure or disruption of utility services (collectively, “Force Majeure”). The amount of time for a
              party to perform any of its obligations (other than payment obligations) shall be extended by the amount of time it is
              delayed in performing such obligation by reason or any force majeure occurrence whether similar to or different
              from the foregoing types of occurrences.

                   17.15 No Partnership or Joint Venture; No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing contained in this Lease shall
              be deemed or construed to create the relationship of principal and agent, or partnership, or joint venturer, or any
              other relationship between Landlord and Tenant other than landlord and tenant. Landlord shall have no obligations
              hereunder to any person or entity other than Tenant or any person or entity claiming through Tenant, and no other
              parties shall have any rights hereunder as against Landlord.

                   17.16 Access by Landlord. Landlord, Landlord’s agents and employees shall have the right to enter upon any
              and all parts of the Tenant Space at any reasonable time upon prior reasonable written notice accompanied by a
              Tenant representative (except in the case of an emergency when no prior notice or accompaniment shall be required)
              to examine the condition thereof, to clean, to make any repairs, alterations or additions required to be made by
              Landlord hereunder, to show the Tenant Space to prospective purchasers or tenants or mortgage lenders (prospective
              or current), to determine whether Tenant is complying with all of its obligations under this Lease, to exercise any of
              Landlord’s rights or remedies hereunder and for any other purpose deemed reasonable by Landlord. In connection
              with Landlord’s rights hereunder, Landlord shall at all times have and retain a key with which to unlock all of the
              doors in, on or about the Tenant Space, and Landlord shall have the right to use any and all means by which
              Landlord may deem proper to open such doors to obtain entry to the Tenant Space. Tenant hereby waives any claim
              for damages for any injury to Tenant’s business or inconvenience to, or interference with, Tenant’s business, any loss
              of occupancy or quiet enjoyment of the Tenant Space or any other loss occasioned by such entry, and, except with
              regard to a Casualty occurring during such access (in which event such Casualty shall be governed by Article 9
              hereof) Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement or reduction of Rent by reason thereof, and no such entry to the
              Tenant Space shall be deemed or construed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into or a detainer of the Tenant Space
              or an eviction, actual or constructive, of Tenant from any part of the Tenant Space; provided, however, that the
              foregoing waiver shall

                                                                           -28-
                                                                Data Center Lease




              not apply with regard to bodily injury or physical damage to Tenant’s Personal Property or Alterations that occurs
              during any such entry, which is the direct result of the negligence of Landlord, or any member of the Landlord
              Group. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to minimize
              disruption of Tenant’s business or occupancy during such entries.

                   17.17 Rights Reserved by Landlord. Landlord reserves the following rights exercisable without notice (except
              as otherwise expressly provided to the contrary in this Lease) and without being, deemed an eviction or disturbance
              of Tenant’s use or possession of the Tenant Space or giving rise to any claim for set-off or abatement of Rent: (i) to
              change the name or street address of the Building and/or the Property; (ii) to install, affix and maintain all signs on
              the exterior and/or interior of the Building and/or the Property; (iii) to display the Tenant Space, the Building and/or
              the Property to mortgagees, prospective mortgagees, prospective purchasers and ground lessors, and prospective
              lessees at reasonable hours; (iv) to change the arrangement of entrances, doors, corridors, elevators and/or stairs in
              the Building and/or the Property, and/or to make such alterations to the Building as Landlord deems desirable
              (provided that Landlord shall not have the right during the Term to alter or change the arrangement of the entrances,
              doors, corridors, elevators and/or stairs in the Premises); (v) to install, operate and maintain systems which monitor,
              by closed circuit television or otherwise, all persons entering or leaving the Building and/or the Property; (vi) to
              install and maintain pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and structural elements located in the Tenant Space and which
              serve other parts or other tenants or occupants of the Building and/or the Property; (vii) to retain at all times master
              keys or pass keys to the Tenant Space; (viii) the exclusive right to create any additional improvements to structural
              and/or mechanical systems, interior and exterior walls and/or glass, which Landlord deems necessary without the
              prior consent of Tenant; and (ix) the absolute right to lease space in the Building and the Property and to create such
              other tenancies in the Building and the Property as Landlord, in its sole business judgment, shall determine is in the
              best interests of the Property (and Landlord does not represent and Tenant does not rely upon any specific type or
              number of tenants occupying any space in the Building and the Property during the Term of this Lease).
              Notwithstanding anything in Sections 17.16 and 17.17, the Building Rules and Regulations or any maintenance
              schedule relative to Landlord’s access to the Tenant Space to the contrary, Landlord agrees that (except in the case of
              an emergency) Landlord’s access to the Tenant Space shall be subject to Landlord’s compliance with the reasonable
              procedures required by Tenant (which shall include accompaniment by a Tenant representative), provided that
              (i) Landlord has received written notice of such amended procedures, and (ii) such procedures do not unreasonably
              interfere with Landlord’s ability to perform Landlord’s obligations under this Lease or any other lease demising
              premises in the Building.

                   17.18 Counterparts; Execution by Facsimile. This Lease may be executed simultaneously in two or more
              counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same Lease.
              Landlord and Tenant agree that the delivery of an executed copy of this Lease by facsimile shall be legal and
              binding and shall have the same full force and effect as if an original executed copy of this Lease had been
              delivered.

                   17.19 Confidentiality/Financial Information.
                        17.19.1 Each party agrees that (i) the terms and provisions of this Lease are confidential and constitute
              proprietary information of the parties and (ii) it shall not disclose or issue any press release, and it shall cause its
              partners, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, brokers and attorneys to not disclose any term or provision of
              this Lease to any other person without first obtaining the prior written consent of the other party, except that each
              party shall have the right to disclose such information for valid business, legal and accounting purposes and/or if
              advisable under any applicable securities laws regarding public disclosure of business information.

                       17.19.2 Tenant agrees to furnish to Landlord on June 1 and December 31 of each calendar year during the
              Term, copies of all financial statements relating to the Tenant Space and Tenant’s operation thereof (whether or not
              publicly disclosed) prepared in the

                                                                           -29-
                                                                 Data Center Lease




              ordinary course of its business. Landlord hereby agrees to maintain such financial information as proprietary and
              confidential and agrees not to disclose any such information to any third party other than any lender, mortgagee, or
              prospective purchaser of the Building, and Landlord’s attorneys, accountants and similar business advisors;
              provided, however, any such disclosure of financial information to any of the foregoing parties may only be made
              subject to disclosure restrictions that are at least as restrictive as the provisions set forth in this Section 17.19. The
              foregoing notwithstanding, so long as Tenant finances none of its Alterations or Tenant’s Personal Property through
              Landlord, or any member of the Landlord Group, Tenant shall not be requirement to comply with the terms of this
              Section 17.19.2.

                  17.20 Incorporation of Exhibits. All of the terms and conditions of all of the Exhibits to this Lease are hereby
              incorporated into this Lease.
