32. ENVIRONMENTAL COVENANTS
                   (a) Prior to executing this Lease, Tenant has completed, executed and delivered to Landlord a Hazardous
              Materials Disclosure Certificate (“Initial Disclosure Certificate”), a fully completed copy of which is attached
              hereto as Exhibit G and incorporated herein by this reference. Tenant covenants, represents and warrants to Landlord
              that the information on the Initial Disclosure Certificate is true and correct and accurately describes the Hazardous
              Materials which will be manufactured, treated, used or stored on or about the Premises by Tenant or Tenant’s
              Agents. Tenant shall, upon request by Landlord not more frequently than annually, and at such other times as Tenant
              desires to manufacture, treat, use or store on or about the Premises new or additional Hazardous Materials which
              were not listed on the Initial Disclosure Certificate, complete, execute and deliver to Landlord an updated Disclosure
              Certificate (each, an “Updated Disclosure Certificate”) describing Tenant’s then current and proposed future uses
              of Hazardous Materials on or about the Premises, which Updated Disclosure Certificates shall be in the same format
              as that which is set forth in Exhibit G or in such updated format as Landlord may require from time to time. Tenant
              shall deliver an Updated Disclosure Certificate to Landlord not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date Tenant
              intends to commence the manufacture, treatment, use or storage of new or additional Hazardous Materials on or
              about the Premises, and Landlord shall have the right to approve or disapprove such new or additional Hazardous
              Materials in its sole and absolute discretion. Tenant shall make no use of Hazardous Materials on or about the
              Premises except as described in the Initial Disclosure Certificate or as otherwise approved by Landlord in writing in
              accordance with this Paragraph 32(a).



                    (b) As used in this Lease, the term “Hazardous Materials” shall mean and include any substance that is or
              contains (1) any “hazardous substance” as now or hereafter defined in § 101(14) of the Comprehensive
              Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”) (42 U.S.C. § 9601 et
              seq.) or any regulations promulgated under CERCLA; (2) any “hazardous waste” as now or hereafter defined in the
              Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”) (42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq.) or any regulations
              promulgated under RCRA; (3) any substance now or hereafter regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act, as
              amended (“TSCA”) (15 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.) or any regulations promulgated under TSCA; (4) petroleum,
              petroleum by-products, gasoline, diesel fuel, or other petroleum hydrocarbons; (5) asbestos and asbestos-containing
              material, in any form, whether friable or non-friable; (6) polychlorinated biphenyls; (7) lead and lead-containing
              materials; or (8) any additional substance, material or waste (A) the presence of which on or about the Premises
              (i) requires reporting, investigation or remediation under any Environmental Laws (as hereinafter defined),
              (ii) causes or threatens to cause a nuisance on the Premises or any adjacent area or property or poses or threatens to
              pose a hazard to the health or safety of persons on the Premises or any adjacent area or property, or (iii) which, if it
              emanated or migrated from the Premises, could constitute a trespass, or (B) which is now or is hereafter classified or
              considered to be hazardous or toxic under any Environmental Laws.

                   (c) As used in this Lease, the term “Environmental Laws” shall mean and include (1) CERCLA, RCRA and
              TSCA; and (2) any other federal, state or local laws, ordinances, statutes, codes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees
              now or hereinafter in effect relating to (A) pollution, (B) the protection or regulation of human health, natural
              resources or the environment, (C) the treatment, storage or disposal of Hazardous Materials, or (D) the emission,
              discharge, release or threatened release of Hazardous Materials into the environment.

                   (d) Tenant will (1) not (A) permit Hazardous Materials to be present on or about the Premises except in a
              commercially reasonable manner and quantity strictly necessary for the ordinary performance of Tenant’s business
              or (B) release, discharge or dispose of any Hazardous Materials on, in, at, under, or emanating from, the Premises,
              the Building or the Project; (2) comply with all Environmental Laws relating to the Premises and the use of
              Hazardous Materials on or about the Premises and not engage in or permit others to engage in any activity at the
              Premises in violation of any Environmental Laws; and (3) immediately notify Landlord of (A) any inquiry, test,
              investigation or enforcement proceeding by any governmental agency or authority against Tenant, Landlord or the
              Premises, Building or Project relating to any Hazardous Materials or under any Environmental Laws or (B) the
              occurrence of any event or existence of any condition that would cause a breach of any of the covenants set forth in
              this Paragraph 32.

                   (e) If Tenant’s use of Hazardous Materials on or about the Premises results in a release, discharge or disposal of
              Hazardous Materials on, in, at, under, or emanating from, the Premises, the Building or the Project, Tenant agrees to
              investigate, clean up, remove or remediate such Hazardous Materials in full compliance with (1) the requirements of
              (A) all Environmental Laws and (B) any governmental agency or authority responsible for the enforcement of any
              Environmental Laws; and (2) any additional requirements of Landlord that are necessary, in Landlord’s sole
              discretion, to protect the value of the Premises, the Building or the Project. Landlord shall also have the right, but
              not the obligation, to take whatever action

 

              with respect to any such Hazardous Materials that it deems necessary, in Landlord’s sole discretion, to protect the
              value of the Premises or the property in which the Premises are located. All costs and expenses paid or incurred by
              Landlord in the exercise of such right shall be payable by Tenant promptly upon demand.

                   (f) Upon reasonable notice to Tenant, Landlord may inspect the Premises and surrounding areas for the purpose
              of determining whether there exists on or about the Premises any Hazardous Material or other condition or activity
              that is in violation of the requirements of this Lease or of any Environmental Laws. Such inspections may include,
              but are not limited to, entering the Premises or adjacent property with drill rigs or other machinery for the purpose of
              obtaining laboratory samples. Landlord shall not be limited in the number of such inspections during the Term of
              this Lease. In the event (1) such inspections reveal the presence of any such Hazardous Material caused by Tenant’s
              use of the Premises or other condition or activity caused by Tenant’s use of the Premises in violation of the
              requirements of this Lease or of any Environmental Laws, or (2) Tenant or its Agents contribute or knowingly
              consent to the presence of any Hazardous Materials in, on, under, through or about the Premises, the Building or the
              Project or exacerbate the condition of or the conditions caused by any Hazardous Materials in, on, under, through or
              about the Premises, the Building or the Project, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of such inspections
              within ten (10) days of receipt of a written statement therefor. The cost of such testing shall be an expense of
              Landlord and not reimbursed by Tenant if Tenant has not violated any Environmental Laws. Tenant will supply to
              Landlord such historical and operational information regarding the Premises and surrounding areas as may be
              reasonably requested to facilitate any such inspection and will make available for meetings appropriate personnel
              having knowledge of such matters. Tenant agrees to give Landlord at least sixty (60) days’ prior notice of its
              intention to vacate the Premises so that Landlord will have an opportunity to perform such an inspection prior to
              such vacation. The right granted to Landlord herein to perform inspections shall not create a duty on Landlord’s part
              to inspect the Premises, or liability on the part of Landlord for Tenant’s use, storage, treatment or disposal of
              Hazardous Materials, it being understood that Tenant shall be solely responsible for all liability in connection
              therewith.

                   (g) Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, prior or subsequent to a Default, without in any way
              limiting Landlord’s other rights and remedies under this Lease, to enter upon the Premises, or to take such other
              actions as it deems necessary or advisable, to investigate, clean up, remove or remediate any Hazardous Materials or
              contamination by Hazardous Materials present on, in, at, under, or emanating from, the Premises, the Building or the
              Project in violation of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease or under any Environmental Laws. Notwithstanding any
              other provision of this Lease, Landlord shall also have the right, at its election, in its own name or as Tenant’s agent,
              to negotiate, defend, approve and appeal, at Tenant’s expense, any action taken or order issued by any governmental
              agency or authority with regard to any such Hazardous Materials or contamination by Hazardous Materials. All
              costs and expenses paid or incurred by Landlord in the exercise of the rights set forth in this Paragraph 32 shall be
              payable by Tenant upon demand.

                  (h) Tenant shall surrender the Premises to Landlord upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease free
              of mold, debris, waste and Hazardous Materials and in a condition which complies with all Environmental Laws and
              any additional requirements of Landlord that

              are reasonably necessary to protect the value of the Premises, the Building or the Project, including, without
              limitation, the obtaining of any closure permits or other governmental permits or approvals related to Tenant’s use of
              Hazardous Materials in or about the Premises. Tenant’s obligations and liabilities pursuant to the provisions of this
              Paragraph 32 shall be in addition to any other surrender requirements in this Lease and shall survive the expiration
              or earlier termination of this Lease. If it is determined by Landlord that the condition of all or any portion of the
              Premises, the Building, and/or the Project is not in compliance with the provisions of this Lease with respect to
              Hazardous Materials, mold, debris, or waste, including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws, at the expiration
              or earlier termination of this Lease, then at Landlord’s sole option, Landlord may require Tenant to hold over
              possession of the Premises until Tenant can surrender the Premises to Landlord in the condition in which the
              Premises existed as of the Commencement Date and prior to the appearance of such Hazardous Materials except for
              normal wear and tear, including, without limitation, the conduct or performance of any closures as required by any
              Environmental Laws. The burden of proof hereunder shall be upon Tenant. For purposes hereof, the term “normal
              wear and tear” shall not include any deterioration in the condition or diminution of the value of any portion of the
              Premises, the Building, and/or the Project in any manner whatsoever related to directly, or indirectly, Hazardous
              Materials. Any such holdover by Tenant will be with Landlord’s consent, will not be terminable by Tenant in any
              event or circumstance and will otherwise be subject to the provisions of Paragraph 35 of this Lease.

                  (i) Tenant shall indemnify and hold harmless Landlord from and against any and all claims, damages, fines,
              judgments, penalties, costs, losses (including, without limitation, loss in value of the Premises, the Building or the
              Project, damages due to loss or restriction of rentable or useable space, and damages due to any adverse impact on
              marketing of the space and any and all sums paid for settlement of claims, liabilities and expenses (including,
              without limitation, attorneys’, consultants’, and experts’ fees)) incurred by Landlord during or after the term of this
              Lease and attributable to (1) any Hazardous Materials placed on or about the Premises, the Building or the Project
              by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents, or resulting from the action or inaction of Tenant or Tenant’s Agents, or (2) Tenant’s
              breach of any provision of this Paragraph 32. This indemnification includes, without limitation, any and all costs
              incurred by Landlord due to any investigation of the site or any cleanup, removal or restoration mandated by a
              federal, state or local agency or political subdivision.

                   (j) Because mold spores are present essentially everywhere and mold can grow in almost any moist location,
              Tenant acknowledges the necessity of adopting and enforcing good housekeeping practices, ventilation and vigilant
              moisture control within the Premises (particularly in kitchen areas, janitorial closets, bathrooms, in and around water
              fountains and other plumbing facilities and fixtures, break rooms, in and around outside walls, and in and around
              HVAC systems and associated drains) for the prevention of mold (such measures, “Mold Prevention Practices”).
              Tenant will, at its sole cost and expense, keep and maintain the Premises in good order and condition in accordance
              with the Mold Prevention Practices and acknowledges that the control of moisture, and prevention of mold within
              the Premises are integral to its obligations under this Lease.

                   (k) Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall:

 

                       (i) Regularly monitor the Premises for the presence of mold and any conditions that reasonably can be
              expected to give rise to or be attributed to mold including, but not limited to, observed or suspected instances of
              water damage, condensation, seepage, leaks, or any other water collection or penetration (from any source, internal
              or external), mold growth, mildew, repeated complaints of respiratory ailments or eye irritation by Tenant’s
              employees or any other occupants of the Premises, or any notice from a governmental agency of complaints
              regarding the indoor air quality at the Premises (the “Mold Conditions”); and

                      (ii) Immediately notify Landlord in writing if it observes, suspects, has reason to believe or should know of
              mold or Mold Conditions are present in, at, or about the Premises.

                   (l) In the event of suspected mold or Mold Conditions in, at, or about the Premises and surroundings areas,
              Landlord may cause an inspection of the Premises to be conducted, during such time as Landlord may designate, to
              determine if mold or Mold Conditions are present in, at, or about the Premises.

                   (m) Tenant releases and relieves Landlord from any and all liability for bodily injury and damage to property,
              waives any and all claims against Landlord, and assumes all risk of personal injury and property damage related to
              or allegedly caused by or associated with any mold or Mold Conditions in or on the Premises existing on the
              Commencement Date or arising thereafter.

                   (n) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Paragraph 32, in no event shall Tenant be
              required to clean up, remove or remediate or be liable for any Pre-Existing Hazardous Materials in or at the
              Premises, except to the extent that any hazard posed by such Pre-Existing Hazardous Materials is exacerbated by, or
              the cost to clean up, remove or remediate such Pre-Existing Hazardous Materials is increased as a result of, the acts
              or omissions of Tenant or Tenant’s Agents. Further, in no event shall Tenant be liable for any claims, damages or
              losses due to the effects of Hazardous Materials on the Premises, the Building or the Project caused by owners,
              tenants, licensees, or invitees of other properties or other third parties (excluding Tenant and Tenant’s Agents),
              except to the extent that any hazard posed by such Hazardous Materials is exacerbated by, or the cost to clean up,
              remove or remediate such Hazardous Materials is increased as a result of, the acts or omissions of Tenant or Tenant’s
              Agents. For purposes of this Paragraph 32, the term “Pre-Existing Hazardous Materials” shall mean Hazardous
              Materials (classified as such on the Commencement Date) existing in or at the Premises on the date physical
              possession thereof is delivered to Tenant.

                   (o) The provisions of this Paragraph 32 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.
