19. **INSURANCE.** Landlord shall maintain in full force and effect policies of insurance covering the Total Property in an amount not less than eighty percent (80%) of the Total Property’s “replacement cost”, as such term is defined in the Replacement Cost Endorsement attached to such policy, insuring against physical loss or damage generally included in the classification of “all risk” coverage. Such insurance shall be for the sole benefit of Landlord, and under Landlord’s sole control.

Tenant shall maintain in full force and effect throughout the term of this Lease policies providing “all risk” insurance coverage protecting against physical damage (including, but not limited to, fire, lightning, extended coverage perils, vandalism, sprinkler leakage, water damage, collapse, and other special extended perils) to the extent of 100% of the replacement cost of Tenant’s property and improvements, as well as broad form comprehensive or commercial general liability insurance, in an occurrence form, insuring Landlord and Tenant jointly against any liability (including bodily injury, property damage and contractual liability) arising out of Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, with a combined single limit of not less than $2,000,0000 or a greater amount as may be reasonably required by Landlord from time to time. All such policies shall be of a form and content satisfactory to Landlord; and Landlord, its property manager and any mortgagee shall be named as an additional insured on all such policies. All policies shall be with companies licensed to do business in the State of [Maryland](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.lawinsider.com/contracts/tagged/maryland-us), and rated A+:XV in the most current issue of Best’s Key Rating Guide. Tenant shall furnish Landlord with certificates of all policies at least ten (10) days prior to occupancy; and, further, such policies shall provide that not less than thirty (30) days written notice be given to Landlord before any such policies are canceled or substantially changed to reduce the insurance provided thereby. All such policies shall be primary and noncontributing with or in excess of any insurance carried by Landlord. Tenant shall not do any act which may make void or voidable any insurance on the Premises or the Total Property; and, in the event Tenant’s use of the Premises shall result in an increase in Landlord’s insurance premiums, Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand, as Additional Rent, an amount equal to such increase in insurance.

As often as any such policy shall expire or terminate, renewal or additional policies shall be procured and maintained by Tenant in like manner and to like extent. In the event Tenant shall fail to promptly furnish any insurance herein required, Landlord may effect the same for a period not exceeding one (1) year and Tenant shall promptly reimburse Landlord upon demand, as additional rent, the premium so paid by Landlord. All such public liability, property damage and other casualty policies shall be written as primary policies which do not contribute to and are not in excess of coverage which Landlord may carry, if any. All such public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that Landlord shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under said policies for any loss occasioned to it, its servants, agents and employees by reason of the negligence of Tenant or any other named assured. Any insurance provided for may be affected by a policy or policies of blanket insurance covering additional items or locations; provided, however, that (i) Landlord shall be named as an additional insured thereunder as its interests may appear; (ii) the coverage afforded Landlord will not be reduced or diminished by reason of the use of such blanket policy of insurance; and (iii) the requirements set forth herein are otherwise satisfied. Any insurance policies herein required to be procured by Tenant shall contain an express waiver of any right of subrogation by the insurance company against the Landlord, and all other tenants or occupants of space in the Total Property.
