41. RULES AND REGULATIONS
                   Tenant shall comply with the rules and regulations attached hereto as Exhibit D, along with any modifications,
              amendments and supplements thereto, and such reasonable rules and regulations as Landlord may adopt in the future
              from time to time for the orderly and proper operation of the Building and the Project (collectively, the “Rules and
              Regulations”). The Rules and Regulations may include, but shall not be limited to the following: (a) restriction of
              employee parking to a limited, designated area or areas; and (b) regulation of the removal, storage and disposal of
              Tenant’s refuse and other rubbish at the sole cost and expense of Tenant. The then-current Rules and Regulations
              shall be binding upon Tenant upon delivery of a copy of them to Tenant. Landlord shall not be responsible to Tenant
              for the failure of any other person to observe and abide by any of said Rules and Regulations.

              42. MORTGAGEE PROTECTION
                   (a) Modifications for Lender. If, in connection with obtaining financing for the Project or any portion thereof,
              Landlord’s lender shall request reasonable modifications to this Lease as a condition to such financing, Tenant shall
              not unreasonably withhold, delay or defer its consent to such modifications, provided such modifications do not
              materially adversely affect Tenant’s rights or increase Tenant’s obligations under this Lease.

                   (b) Rights to Cure. Tenant agrees to give to any trust deed or mortgage holder (“Holder”), by a method
              provided for in Paragraph 33 above, at the same time as it is given to Landlord, a copy of any notice of default given
              to Landlord, provided that prior to such notice Tenant has been notified, in writing, (by way of notice of assignment
              of rents and leases, or otherwise) of the address of such Holder. Tenant further agrees that if Landlord shall have
              failed to cure such default within the time provided for in this Lease, then the Holder shall have an additional
              reasonable period within which to cure such default or if such default cannot be cured without Holder pursuing its
              remedies against Landlord, then such additional time as may be necessary to commence and complete a foreclosure
              proceeding, provided Holder commences and thereafter diligently pursues the remedies necessary to cure such
              default (including but not limited to commencement of foreclosure proceedings, if necessary to effect such cure), in
              which event this Lease shall not be terminated.



              43. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

              44. PARKING
                   (a) Provided that Tenant shall not then be in Default under the terms and conditions of this Lease, and provided
              further, that Tenant shall comply with and abide by Landlord’s parking rules and regulations from time to time in
              effect, (i) Tenant shall have a license to use the Parking Area for the parking of standard size passenger automobiles,
              pick-up trucks, vans, SUV’s, and Tenant-owned delivery vehicles the number of parking spaces set forth in the Basic
              Lease Information and (ii) Tenant shall have the license to use, on a non-exclusive basis, for the parking of Tenant’s
              trucks and trailers, the areas designated from time to time by Landlord as truck and trailer parking areas; provided,
              however, that Landlord shall not be required to enforce Tenant’s right to use such parking spaces and parking areas,
              if any; and, provided further, that the number of parking spaces and parking areas allocated to Tenant hereunder
              shall be reduced on a proportionate basis in the event any of the parking spaces or other areas in the parking areas
              are taken or otherwise eliminated as a result of any Condemnation (as hereinafter defined) or casualty event
              affecting such parking areas or any modifications made by Landlord to such parking areas. All unreserved spaces
              and other areas will be on a first-come, first-served basis in common with other tenants of and visitors to the Project
              in parking spaces or other areas provided by Landlord from time to time in the Project’s parking areas. In the event
              Tenant is granted the use of exclusive and designated parking spaces, as indicated in the Basic Lease Information,
              then such spaces shall be located in the area(s) designated by Landlord from time to time. Tenant’s license to use the
              parking spaces or other areas provided for herein shall be subject to such terms, conditions, rules and regulations as
              Landlord or the operator of the parking areas may impose from time to time, including, without limitation, the
              imposition of a parking charge.

                   (b) If at any time Landlord shall make available to Tenant any parking area outside the Premises, then each
              vehicle, truck or trailer using such parking area shall, at Landlord’s option to be exercised from time to time, bear a
              permanently affixed and visible identification sticker to be provided by Landlord. Tenant shall not and shall not
              permit its Agents to park any vehicles in locations other than those specifically designated by Landlord as being for
              Tenant’s use, including, without limitation, the parking of trucks and trailers only in areas so designated by Landlord
              and in no other areas. The license granted hereunder is for self-service parking only and does not include additional
              rights or services. Neither Landlord nor Landlord’s Agents shall be liable for: (i) loss or damage to any vehicle or
              other personal property parked or located upon or within the Parking Area or elsewhere in the Project whether
              pursuant to this license or otherwise and whether caused by fire, theft, explosion, strikes, riots or any other cause
              whatsoever; or (ii) injury to or death of any person in, about or around the Parking Area or elsewhere in the Project
              or any vehicles parking therein or in proximity thereto whether caused by fire, theft, assault, explosion, riot or any
              other cause whatsoever and Tenant hereby waives any claim for or in respect to the above and against all claims or
              liabilities arising out of loss or damage to property or injury to or death of persons, or both, relating to any of the
              foregoing. Tenant shall not assign any of its rights hereunder and in the event an attempted assignment is made, it
              shall be void.


                  (c) Tenant recognizes and agrees that visitors, clients and/or customers (collectively the “Visitors”) to the
              Premises must park automobiles or other vehicles only in the Parking Area.

                   (d) In the event any tax, surcharge or regulatory fee is at any time imposed by any governmental authority upon
              or with respect to parking or vehicles parking in the parking spaces referred to herein, Tenant shall pay such tax,
              surcharge or regulatory fee as Additional Rent under this Lease, such payments to be made in advance and from
              time to time as required by Landlord (except that they shall be paid monthly with Base Rent payments if permitted
              by the governmental authority).

                   (e) Intentionally Deleted.
