9.   USE OF PREMISES
                   (a) Permitted Use. The use of the Premises by Tenant and Tenant’s agents, advisors, employees, partners,
              shareholders, directors, customers, invitees and independent contractors (collectively, “Tenant’s Agents”) shall be
              solely for the Permitted Use specified in the Basic



              Lease Information and for no other use. Tenant shall not permit any objectionable or unpleasant odor, smoke, dust,
              gas, noise or vibration to emanate from or near the Premises. The Premises shall not be used to create any nuisance
              or trespass, for any illegal purpose, for any purpose not permitted by Laws (as herein defined), for any purpose that
              would invalidate the insurance or increase the premiums for insurance on the Premises, the Building or the Project
              or for any purpose or in any manner that would interfere with other tenants’ use or occupancy of the Project. If any
              of Tenant’s office machines or equipment disturb any other tenant in the Building, then Tenant shall provide
              adequate insulation or take such other action as may be necessary to eliminate the noise or disturbance. Tenant
              agrees to pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, any increases in premiums on policies resulting from Tenant’s
              Permitted Use or any other use or action by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents which increases Landlord’s premiums or
              requires additional coverage by Landlord to insure the Premises. Tenant agrees not to overload the floor(s) of the
              Building.

                   (b) Compliance with Governmental Regulations and Private Restrictions. Tenant and Tenant’s Agents shall,
              at Tenant’s expense, faithfully observe and comply with (1) all municipal, state and federal laws, statutes, codes,
              rules, regulations, ordinances, requirements, and orders (collectively, “Laws”), now in force or which may hereafter
              be in force pertaining to the Premises or Tenant’s use of the Premises, the Building or the Project, including without
              limitation, any Laws requiring installation of fire sprinkler systems, seismic reinforcement and related alterations,
              whether substantial in cost or otherwise, provided, however, that except as provided in Paragraph 9(c) below, Tenant
              shall not be required to make or, except as provided in Paragraph 4 above, pay for, structural changes to the
              Premises or the Building not related to Tenant’s specific use of the Premises unless the requirement for such changes
              is imposed as a result of any improvements or additions made or proposed to be made at Tenant’s request; (2) all
              recorded covenants, conditions and restrictions affecting the Project (“Private Restrictions”) now in force or which
              may hereafter be in force; and (3) the Rules and Regulations (as defined in Paragraph 41 of this Lease). Without
              limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent Landlord is required by the city or county in which the
              Building is located to maintain carpooling and public transit programs, Tenant shall cooperate in the implementation
              and use of those programs by and among Tenant’s employees. The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction,
              or the admission of Tenant in any action or proceeding against Tenant, whether Landlord be a party thereto or not,
              that Tenant has violated any Laws or Private Restrictions, shall be conclusive of that fact as between Landlord and
              Tenant.

                   (c) Compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act. The Premises, the Building and/or the Project may be
              subject to, among other Laws, the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., including, but not
              limited to Title III thereof, Title 24 of the State of California Code, and all regulations and guidelines related thereto,
              together with any and all laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, codes and statutes now or hereafter enacted by local or
              state agencies having jurisdiction thereof, as the same may be in effect on the date of this Lease and may be
              hereafter modified, amended or supplemented (collectively, the “ADA”). Any Tenant Improvements to be
              constructed hereunder shall comply with the ADA, and all costs incurred to comply therewith shall be a part of and
              included in the cost of the Tenant Improvements. Tenant shall be solely responsible for conducting its own
              independent investigation of this matter and for ensuring that the design of all Tenant Improvements strictly
              complies with all requirements of the ADA. Subject to reimbursement to the extent permitted pursuant to
              Paragraph 4(b) above,


              if any barrier removal work or other work is required to the Building, the Common Areas or the Project under the
              ADA, then such work shall be the responsibility of Landlord; provided, if such work is required under the ADA as a
              result of Tenant’s use of the Premises or any work or Alteration (as hereinafter defined) made to the Premises by or
              on behalf of Tenant, then such work shall be performed by Landlord at the sole cost and expense of Tenant. Except
              as otherwise expressly provided in this provision and Section 10 below, Tenant shall be responsible at its sole cost
              and expense for fully and faithfully complying with all applicable requirements of the ADA. Within ten (10) days
              after receipt, Tenant shall advise Landlord in writing, and provide Landlord with copies of (as applicable), any
              notices alleging violation of the ADA relating to any portion of the Premises, the Building or the Project; any claims
              made or threatened orally or in writing regarding noncompliance with the ADA and relating to any portion of the
              Premises, the Building, or the Project; or any governmental or regulatory actions or investigations instituted or
              threatened regarding noncompliance with the ADA and relating to any portion of the Premises, the Building or the
              Project. Tenant shall and hereby agrees to protect, defend (with counsel acceptable to Landlord) and hold Landlord
              and Landlord’s Agents harmless and indemnify Landlord and Landlord’s Agents from and against all liabilities,
              damages, claims, losses, penalties, judgments, charges and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs of court and
              expenses necessary in the prosecution or defense of any litigation including the enforcement of this provision)
              arising from or in any way related to, directly or indirectly, Tenant’s or Tenant’s Agents’ violation or alleged
              violation of the ADA. Tenant agrees that the obligations of Tenant herein shall survive the expiration or earlier
              termination of this Lease

                   (d) No Roof Access. At no time during the Term shall Tenant have access to the roof of the Building or have the
              right to install, operate or maintain a satellite-earth communications station (antenna and associated equipment),
              microwave equipment and/or an FM antenna on the Building or the Project.
