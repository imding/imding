(a) Total - If during the term, all or a substantial part of the Leased Premises or the common areas of the Total Property shall be taken by condemnation or eminent domain, this Lease shall terminate as of, and the rent shall be apportioned to and xxxxx from and after, the date of taking and Tenant shall have no right to participate in any award or damages for such taking and Tenant hereby assigns all of its right, title and interest therein to Landlord with a power of attorney coupled with an interest for the execution in the Tenant’s name of any and all documents necessary or desirable in connection therewith. For purposes of this Subsection, “a substantial part of the Leased Premises or the common areas of the Total Property” shall mean such part thereof that the remainder of the Leased Premises or the Total Property, as the case may be, are rendered inadequate and cannot practicably be repaired and improved so as to be made adequate to permit Tenant to use and enjoy the Leased Premises and/or the common areas of the Total Property to substantially the same extent as before the taking. Landlord shall promptly notify Tenant of any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, or threatened condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, as the same becomes known to Landlord.

(b) Partial - If during the term, the Leased Premises or the common areas of the Total Property are partially taken by condemnation or eminent domain, Landlord shall employ reasonable means to restore the Leased Premises or the common areas of the Total Property, as the case may be, and all proceeds derived from the condemnation as hereinabove provided shall be applied by Landlord towards the cost of restoration of the Leased Premises or the common areas of the Total Property, as the case may be. If a portion of the Leased Premises (as compared to the common areas of the Total Property) is so taken, all rent shall be abated from and after the date of taking in equitable proportion to the portion of the Leased Premises so taken. Landlord shall promptly immediately notify Tenant of any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, or threatened condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, as the same becomes known to Landlord.
