49. NAME OF BUILDING
                   In the event Landlord chooses to change the name or address of the Building and/or the Project, Tenant agrees
              that such change shall not affect in any way its obligations under this Lease, and that, except for the name or address
              change, all terms and conditions of this Lease shall remain in full force and effect. Tenant agrees further that such
              name or address change shall not require a formal amendment to this Lease, but shall be effective upon Tenant’s
              receipt of written notification from Landlord of said change.



              50. SECURITY
                   (a) Tenant acknowledges and agrees that, while Landlord, in its sole and absolute discretion, may engage
              security personnel to patrol the Building or the Project, Landlord is not providing any security services with respect
              to the Premises, the Building or the Project and that Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for, and Tenant waives
              any claim against Landlord with respect to, any bodily injury, loss by theft or any other damage suffered or incurred
              by Tenant or Tenant’s employees, invitees, and visitors in connection with any unauthorized entry into the Premises
              or any other breach of security with respect to the Premises, the Building or the Project.

                   (b) Tenant hereby agrees to the exercise by Landlord and Landlord’s Agents, within their sole discretion, of
              such security measures as, but not limited to, the evacuation of the Premises, the Building or the Project for cause,
              suspected cause or for drill purposes, the denial of any access to the Premises, the Building or the Project and other
              similarly related actions that it deems necessary to prevent any threat of property damage or bodily injury. The
              exercise of such security measures by Landlord and Landlord’s Agents, and the resulting interruption of service and
              cessation of Tenant’s business, if any, shall not be deemed an eviction or disturbance of Tenant’s use and possession
              of the Premises, or any part thereof, or render Landlord or Landlord’s Agents liable to Tenant for any resulting
              damages or relieve Tenant from Tenant’s obligations under this Lease.

              51. JURY TRIAL WAIVER
                   Tenant hereby waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action or proceeding (i) brought by Landlord,
              Tenant or any other party, relating to (A) this Lease and/or any understandings or prior dealings between the parties
              hereto, or (B) the Premises, the Building or the Project or any part thereof, or (ii) to which Landlord is a party.
              Tenant hereby agrees that, to the extent permitted by Law, this Lease constitutes a written consent to waiver of trial
              by jury pursuant to the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 631, and Tenant does hereby
              constitute and appoint Landlord its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest,
              and Tenant does hereby authorize and empower Landlord, in the name, place and stead of Tenant, to file this Lease
              with the clerk or judge of any court of competent jurisdiction as a statutory written consent to waiver of trial by jury.

              52. RECORDATION
                  Neither this Lease, nor any memorandum, affidavit or other writing with respect thereto, shall be recorded by
              Tenant or by any one acting through, under or on behalf of Tenant, and the recording thereof in violation of this
              provision shall make this Lease null and void at Landlord’s election.

              53. RIGHT TO LEASE
                    Landlord reserves the absolute right to effect such other tenancies in the Project as Landlord in the exercise of
              its sole business judgment shall determine to best promote the interest of the Project. Tenant does not rely on the
              fact, nor does Landlord represent, that any specific tenant or type or number of tenants shall, during the Lease Term,
              occupy any space in the Project.



              54. FORCE MAJEURE
                   Any prevention, delay or stoppage due to strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, acts of God, inability to obtain
              services, labor, or materials or reasonable substitutes therefor, governmental actions, civil comrnotions, insurrection,
              war, acts of terrorism, fire or other casualty, and other causes beyond the reasonable control of the party obligated to
              perform, except with respect to the obligations imposed with regard to Rent and other charges to be paid by Tenant
              pursuant to this Lease (each, a “Force Majeure”), notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease,
              shall excuse the performance of such party for a period equal to any such prevention, delay or stoppage and
              therefore, if this Lease specifies a time period for performance of an obligation of either party, that time period shall
              be extended by the period of any delay in such party’s performance cause by a Force Majeure.

              55. ACCEPTANCE
                   This Lease shall only become effective and binding upon full execution hereof by Landlord and delivery of a
              signed copy to Tenant and Landlord’s receipt of the Security Deposit, Prepaid Rent, and the first installment of
              estimated Additional Rent.

              56. RENEWAL OPTION
                   (a) Exercise of Options. Provided Tenant is not in default (beyond applicable notice and grace periods)
              pursuant to any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, Tenant shall have the option (the “Option”) to renew this
              Lease for an additional five (5) year period (the “Option Period”) for the period commencing on the date following
              the Expiration Date upon the terms and conditions contained in this Lease, except as provided in this Paragraph 56.
              To exercise the Option, Tenant shall give Landlord notice (the “Extension Notice”) of exercise not less than six
              (6) months or more than fifteen (15) months prior to the date on which the Option Period which is the subject of the
              notice will commence. The notice shall be given as provided in Paragraph 33 hereof. In the event Tenant shall
              exercise the Option, this Lease will terminate in its entirety at the end of the Option Period and Tenant will have no
              further Options to renew or extend the Term of this Lease.

                   (b) Determination of Base Rent. The Base Rent for the Option Period, shall be determined as follows:

                        (i) Landlord and Tenant will have thirty (30) days after Landlord receives the Extension Notice within
              which to agree on the fair market rental value of the Premises as of the commencement date of the Option Period, as
              defined in subsection (ii) below. If they agree on such value within thirty (30) days, such value shall be the Base
              Rent for the Option Period, and the parties will amend this Lease by stating the Base Rent.

                         (ii) If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree on the Base Rent for the Option Period within thirty
              (30) days, the Base Rent for the Option Period will be the greater of (i) the-fair market rental value of the Premises
              as of the commencement date of the Option Period as determined in accordance with subsection (iii) hereof, and
              (ii) the highest Base Rent set forth in the Basic Lease Information. As used in this Lease, the “fair market rental
              value of the Premises” means what a landlord under no compulsion to lease the Premises, and a tenant under


              no compulsion to lease the Premises, would determine as Base Rent (including initial monthly rent and rental
              increases) for the Option Period, as of the commencement of the Option Period, taking into consideration the uses
              permitted under this Lease, the quality, size, design, location and amenities of the Premises and the Project, and the
              rent for comparable buildings located in the vicinity of the Project (including rent abatements and other
              concessions); provided, however, that neither the initial Tenant Improvements to the Premises, nor any Alterations
              installed in the Premises by or for Tenant, shall be taken into consideration.

                        (iii) Within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the thirty (30) day period set forth in subparagraph (ii)
              above, Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint one licensed real estate appraiser or real estate broker (such broker to
              have no less than ten (10) years of relevant experience relating to the rental of space comparable to the Premises in
              the applicable submarket in which the Project is located) (collectively, the “Appraisers”) (Landlord and Tenant to
              each pay the cost of their own Appraiser), and the Appraisers so appointed shall jointly attempt to determine and
              agree upon the then fair market rental value of the Premises. If they are unable to agree, then each Appraiser so
              appointed shall set one value, and notify the other Appraiser, of the value set by him or her, concurrently with such
              Appraiser’s receipt of the value set by the other Appraiser. The two Appraisers then shall, together, select a third
              licensed appraiser or broker (such broker to have no less than ten (10) years of relevant experience relating to the
              rental of space comparable to the Premises in the applicable submarket in which the Project is located) (the cost of
              such third appraiser or broker shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant), who shall make a determination of
              the then fair market rental value, after reviewing the reports of the first two Appraisers appointed by the parties, and
              after doing such independent research as he/she deems appropriate. The value determined by the third appraiser or
              broker shall be the then fair market rental value of the Premises.
