6. USE.
                    6.1 Permitted Use. Subject to the terms of this Lease, including, specifically, Sections 1.3 and 6.3.1, Tenant shall be
              entitled to use the Tenant Space only for the placement, maintenance and operation of computer, switch and/or communications
              equipment, fixtures, machinery, apparatus, systems, connections, interconnections, appurtenances and the like (in accordance
              with the terms of this Lease, including, specifically, Sections 8.4 and 13.1) (the “Permitted Use”). Any other use of the Tenant
              Space is subject to Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent may be withheld or conditioned in Landlord’s sole and
              absolute discretion. Additionally, and not withstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.1, Tenant may not
              operate a Meet-Me Room in the Tenant Space or any other portion of the Building, provide MMR Services (as defined below)
              in the Tenant Space or any other portion of the Building, or refer to the Tenant Space as a Meet-Me Room. As used herein
              “MMR Services” means the services typically provided by companies in the primary business of providing carrier-neutral
              interconnections, such as the Switch & Data, Equinix, CRG West and Telehouse, including without limitation, furnishing of
              space, racks and pathway to parties for the purpose of such party’s placement and maintenance of computer, switch and/or
              communications equipment and connections with the communications cable and facilities of other parties in the Building.

                   6.2 Datacenter Rules and Regulations. Tenant’s Permitted Use shall be subject to, and Tenant, and Tenant’s agents,
              employees and invitees shall comply fully with all requirements of the Datacenter Rules and Regulations. Landlord shall at all
              times have the right to change such rules and regulations or to amend or supplement them in such manner as may be deemed
              (by Landlord in the exercise of its sole but good faith discretion) advisable for the safety, care and cleanliness of the Tenant
              Space, the Datacenter, the Building and the Property and for preservation of good order therein, all of which Datacenter Rules
              and Regulations, as changed, amended, and/or supplemented from time to time, shall be fully carried out and strictly observed
              by Tenant; provided, however, that such changes to the Datacenter Rules and Regulations may not increase Tenant’s monetary
              obligations under this Lease or unreasonably interfere with access to or the beneficial use of the Tenant Space for the Permitted
              Use. In the event of a conflict between the Datacenter Rules and Regulations and the terms of this Lease, the terms of this
              Lease shall govern. Tenant shall further be responsible for the compliance with such Datacenter Rules and Regulations (as the
              same may be changed, amended and/or supplemented from time to time) by the employees, agents and invitees of Tenant.
              Landlord shall apply the Datacenter Rules and Regulations in a non-discriminatory manner and uniformly to the tenants of the
              Datacenter.

                   6.3 Compliance with Laws; Hazardous Materials.
                        6.3.1 Compliance with Laws. Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, shall timely take all action required to cause
              the Tenant Space to comply in all respects with all laws, ordinances, building codes, rules, regulations, orders and directives of
              any governmental authority having jurisdiction (including without limitation any certificate of occupancy), and all covenants,
              conditions and restrictions affecting the Property now or in the future applicable to the Tenant Space (collectively, “Applicable
              Laws”) and with all rules, orders, regulations and requirements of any applicable fire rating bureau or other organization
              performing a similar function. Tenant shall not use the Tenant Space, or permit the Tenant Space to be used, in any manner, or
              do or suffer any act in or about the Tenant Space which: (i) violates or conflicts with any Applicable Law; (ii) causes or is
              reasonably likely to cause damage to the Property, the Building, the Tenant Space or the Building and/or Property systems and
              equipment, including, without limitation, all fire/life safety, electrical, HVAC, plumbing or sprinkler, access control (including,
              without limitation, Landlord’s Access Control Systems), mechanical, telecommunications, elevator and escalator

                                                                              -6-





              systems and equipment (collectively, the “Building Systems”); (iii) will invalidate or otherwise violates a requirement or
              condition of any fire, extended coverage or any other insurance policy covering the Property, the Building, and/or the Tenant
              Space, or the property located therein, or will increase the cost of any of the same (unless, at Landlord’s election, Landlord
              permits an activity which will cause an increase in any such insurance rates on the condition that Tenant shall agree in writing
              to pay any such increase to Landlord immediately upon demand as Additional Rent); (iv) constitutes or is reasonably likely to
              constitute a nuisance to other tenants or occupants of the Datacenter, the Building or the Property, or any equipment, facilities
              or systems of any such Tenant; (v) interferes with, or is reasonably likely to interfere with, the transmission or reception of
              microwave, television, radio, telephone, or other communication signals by antennae or other facilities located at the Property;
              (vi) amounts to (or results in) the commission of waste in the Tenant Space, the Datacenter, the Building or the Property;
              (vii) violates the Datacenter Rules and Regulations; or (viii) is other than the Permitted Use. Tenant shall be responsible for any
              losses, costs or damages in the event that unauthorized parties gain access to the Tenant Space, the Building or the Datacenter
              through access cards, keys or other access devices provided to Tenant by Landlord. Tenant shall promptly upon demand
              reimburse Landlord as Additional Rent for any additional premium charged for any insurance policy by reason of Tenant’s
              failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.3. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, as between
              Landlord and Tenant, (1) Tenant shall bear the responsibility and cost of complying with all Applicable Laws (including
              without limitation, Title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, any state laws governing handicapped access or
              architectural barriers, and all rules, regulations, and guidelines promulgated under such laws, as amended from time to time
              (the “Disabilities Acts”)) in the Tenant Space (except as to Landlord’s Installations listed on Exhibit “E,” for which Landlord
              shall be responsible), and (2) Landlord shall bear the responsibility and cost of complying with all Applicable Laws, including
              the Disabilities Acts, (aa) in the common areas, (bb) in the Tenant Space, but only with respect to Landlord’s Installations, and
              (cc) related to the Building’s structure and the Building’s utility and life-safety systems, other than (i) compliance that is
              necessitated by the use of the Tenant Space, or (ii) compliance that is necessitated with regard to any portion of the Tenant
              Space that is not Landlord’s Installations (in either case, responsibility and cost of which shall be borne by Tenant).

                          6.3.2 Hazardous Materials. No Hazardous Materials (defined below) shall be Handled (defined below) upon, about,
              in, at, above or beneath the Tenant Space or any portion of the Building or the Property by or on behalf of Tenant, its
              Transferees (defined in 10.1, below), or their respective contractors, clients, officers, directors, employees, representatives,
              licensees, agents, or invitees (the “Tenant Parties”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, normal quantities of those Hazardous
              Materials customarily used in the conduct of the Permitted Use may be used at the Tenant Space without Landlord’s prior
              written consent, but only in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws (defined below) and only in a manner
              consistent with Institutional Owner Practices (defined in Section 8.3, below). “Environmental Laws” shall mean and include
              all now and hereafter existing Applicable Laws regulating, relating to, or imposing liability or standards of conduct concerning
              public health and safety or the environment. “Hazardous Materials” shall mean and include: (1) any material or substance:
              (i) which is defined or becomes defined as a “hazardous substance,” “hazardous waste,” “infectious waste,” “chemical mixture
              or substance,” or “air pollutant” under Environmental Laws; (ii) containing petroleum, crude oil or any fraction thereof;
              (iii) containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB’s); (iv) asbestos, asbestos-containing materials or presumed asbestos-
              containing materials (collectively, “ACM”); (v) which is radioactive; (vi) which is infectious; or (2) any other material or
              substance displaying toxic, reactive, ignitable or corrosive characteristics, and are defined, or become defined by any
              Environmental Law. “Handle,” “Handled,” or “Handling” shall mean any installation, handling, generation, storage,
              treatment, use, disposal, discharge, release, manufacture, refinement, presence, migration, emission, abatement, removal,
              transportation, or any other activity of any type in connection with or involving Hazardous Materials.

                   6.4 Electricity Consumption Threshold. Tenant’s actual electricity consumption for the Premises, as reasonably
              determined by Landlord pursuant to such measurement method or methods as Landlord shall employ from time to time acting
              consistently with Institutional Owner Practices (including, without limitation, the use of submeters and/or pulse meters,
              electrical surveys and/or engineer’s estimates), shall not at any time, exceed the number of watts for the Premises specified in
              Item 1 of Exhibit

                                                                              -7-





              “F” (the “Electricity Consumption Threshold”). All equipment (belonging to Tenant or otherwise) located within the
              Premises shall be included in the calculation of Tenant’s actual electricity consumption for the Premises.

                    6.5 Structural Load. Tenant shall not place a load upon the Premises or the Datacenter exceeding the number of pounds
              of live load per square foot specified in Item 5 of Exhibit “F”. Any cabinets, cages or partitions installed by Landlord shall be
              included in the calculation of the live load.

              7. SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THE TENANT SPACE.
                    7.1 Access Control. Landlord will provide access control as follows: (i) Landlord will operate a check-in desk at the
              Building’s main entrance twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, (ii) Landlord has installed an electronic “key
              card” system and an electronic “biometric” system to control access to the Datacenter, and (iii) Landlord has installed a video
              surveillance system in the Datacenter (collectively, “Landlord’s Access Control Systems”). Landlord disclaims any and all
              other responsibility or, obligation to provide additional access control (or any security) to the Building, the Datacenter, the
              Datacenter Connection Area, the Tenant Space, or any portion of any of the above. Landlord reserves the right, to be exercised
              by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion, but without assuming any duty, to institute additional access control measures in
              order to further control and regulate access to the Building, the Datacenter or any part thereof. Landlord shall not, under any
              circumstances, be responsible for providing or supplying security services to the Tenant Space or any part of the Datacenter or
              the Building in excess of the Landlord’s Access Control Systems expressly set forth in this Section 7.1 (and Landlord shall not
              under any circumstances be deemed to have agreed to provide any services in excess of the above specified Landlord’s Access
              Control Systems). Subject to Landlord’s approval of the plans and specifications therefor and the contractors who will perform
              such work, Tenant may install, at its sole cost and expense, its own security system (“Tenant’s Security System”) for the
              Premises. Tenant shall furnish Landlord with a copy of all key codes, access cards and other entry means and ensure that
              Landlord shall have access to the Premises at all times. Additionally, Tenant shall ensure that Tenant’s Security System shall
              comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, including all fire safety laws, and in no event shall Landlord
              be liable for the malfunctioning thereof, and Tenant shall indemnify Landlord therefrom. Tenant shall have the right, subject to
              Landlord’s reasonable approval and at its sole cost and expense, to integrate Tenant’s security system and management systems
              into Landlord’s Building security system and Building management systems. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that it
              understands that all persons in the Datacenter and the activities of all such persons are and shall be subject to surveillance by
              video camera and/or otherwise by Landlord’s agents and employees. Tenant further acknowledges and agrees that it
              understands that the Datacenter Connection Area is a non-exclusive use area that will be utilized by other tenants of the
              Datacenter.

                   7.2 Electricity; HVAC.
                         7.2.1 Electricity. Landlord shall furnish electricity to the Premises in accordance with the specifications set forth in
              Item 1 of Exhibit “F” attached hereto. The obligation of Landlord to provide electricity to the Tenant Space shall be subject to
              the rules and regulations of the supplier of such electricity and of any governmental authorities regulating providers of
              electricity and shall be limited to providing the Electricity Consumption Threshold (as defined in Section 6.4). Except as
              expressly set forth in Items 2 and 3 of Exhibit “F”, Tenant shall be solely responsible for all emergency, supplemental or back-
              up power systems (“Back-Up Power”) for use in the Tenant Space. Landlord expects its back-up generator (identified in
              Item 3 of Exhibit “F”) to begin operating within the target battery capacity period set forth in Item 2 of Exhibit “F” in the
              event of a utility interruption.

                          7.2.2 HVAC. Landlord shall furnish HVAC (defined below) to the Premises in accordance with the specifications set
              forth in Item 4(c) of Exhibit “F” attached hereto. The obligation of Landlord to provide HVAC to the Premises shall be subject
              to the rules and regulations of the supplier of electricity and of any governmental authorities regulating providers of electricity
              and with the provision of HVAC service, and shall be limited to providing HVAC sufficient to meet the temperature and
              humidity

                                                                              -8-





              targets described in Items 4(a) and 4(b) of Exhibit “F”. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 7.2.2, Tenant shall be
              solely responsible for all emergency, supplemental or back-up HVAC systems (“Supplemental HVAC”) for use in the Tenant
              Space.

                   7.3 Interruption of Services.
                          7.3.1 Landlord shall not be liable or responsible to Tenant for any loss, damage or expense of any type which Tenant
              may sustain or incur if the quantity or character of the utility provided electric service is changed, is no longer available, or is
              no longer suitable for Tenant’s requirements. No interruption or malfunction of any electrical or other service (including,
              without limitation, heating ventilation and air conditioning “HVAC”) to the Tenant Space (or to any other portion of the
              Building or Property) shall, in any event, (i) constitute an eviction or disturbance of Tenant’s use and possession of the Tenant
              Space, (ii) constitute a breach by Landlord of any of Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, (iii) render Landlord liable for
              damages of any type or entitle Tenant to be relieved from any of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease (including the obligation
              to pay Base Rent, Additional Rent, or other charges), (iv) grant Tenant any right of setoff or recoupment, (v) provide Tenant
              with any right to terminate this Lease, or (vi) make Landlord liable for any injury to or interference with Tenant’s business or
              any punitive, incidental or consequential damages (of any type), whether foreseeable or not, whether arising from or relating to
              the making of or failure to make any repairs, alterations or improvements, or whether arising from or related to the provision of
              or failure to provide for or to restore any service in or to any portion of the Property, the Building or the Datacenter. In the
              event of any interruption, however, Landlord shall employ commercially reasonable efforts to restore such service or cause the
              same to be restored in any circumstances in which such restoration is within the reasonable control of Landlord and the
              interruption at issue was not caused in whole or in part by any action of Tenant.

                         7.3.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (a) there is an interruption of Landlord’s services, including,
              but not limited to (i) any interruption of any electrical or other service (including, without limitation, HVAC) to the Tenant
              Space, or (ii) a violation of the service levels described in Exhibit “F”, attached hereto, in the Tenant Space, (b) such
              interruption of Landlord’s services is not caused by any act or omission of Tenant or Tenant’s employees, agents, invitees or
              contractors, nor by a Casualty (as defined in Section 9.1.1, below), and (c) Tenant is prevented from using (and actually does
              not use) the Tenant Space, or any portion thereof, in the ordinary course of Tenant’s business, as determined by Tenant, for a
              period in excess of the timeframe specified in Item 15 of the Basic Lease Information (the “Eligibility Period”) because of the
              interruption of Landlord’s services (such an interruption, an “Interruption of Landlord’s Services”), Tenant shall, as its
              exclusive remedy therefor, be entitled to an abatement of Rent as set forth in Item 15 of the Basic Lease Information.

                          7.3.3 In addition to Tenant’s right to abatement of Base Rent, in the event a Chronic Outage (as hereinafter defined)
              occurs, Tenant may terminate this Lease by delivering to Landlord within five (5) business days following the occurrence of the
              Chronic Outage, written notice (“Tenant’s Chronic Outage Termination Notice”) of such termination. In the event of
              Tenant’s Chronic Outage termination, Landlord and Tenant agree that Tenant shall be permitted to continue its tenancy of the
              Tenant Space for one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s Chronic Outage Termination
              Notice (such period of Tenant’s “post-Chronic Outage termination tenancy” is referred to herein as “Tenant’s Chronic Outage
              Termination Period”); provided, however, that, (a) during Tenant’s Chronic Outage Termination Period, all of the terms of this
              Lease shall continue in full force and effect (including the default and remedy provisions contained herein), and (b) Tenant
              shall have the right to terminate Tenant’s Chronic Outage Termination Period, prior to the one hundred eightieth (180th) day
              thereof, by providing ninety (90) days’ written notice of such early termination to Landlord (“Tenant’s 2nd Chronic Outage
              Termination Notice”), in which case Tenant’s Chronic Outage Termination Period shall expire upon the earlier to occur of
              (i) the one hundred eightieth (180th) day after the date of Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s Chronic Outage Termination Notice;
              and (ii) the ninetieth (90th) day after the date of Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s 2nd Chronic Outage Termination Notice. Tenant’s
              failure to timely deliver Tenant’s Chronic Outage Termination Notice shall automatically extinguish Tenant’s right to terminate
              this Lease with respect to that particular Chronic Outage. As used herein the term “Chronic Outage” means that

                                                                              -9-





              three (3) or more times within a twelve (12) consecutive month period, there occurs an Interruption of Landlord’s Services,
              each occurrence of which continues for twelve (12) or more consecutive hours, regardless of whether or not such Interruption
              of Landlord’s Services was caused by Force Majeure.

                         7.3.4 In addition to Tenant’s right to abatement of Base Rent, in the event a Continuous Outage (as hereinafter
              defined) occurs, Tenant may terminate this Lease by delivering to Landlord within five (5) business days following the
              occurrence of the Continuous Outage, written notice (“Tenant’s Continuous Outage Termination Notice”) of such
              termination. In the event of Tenant’s Continuous Outage termination, Landlord and Tenant agree that Tenant shall be permitted
              to continue its tenancy of the Tenant Space for one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s
              Continuous Outage Termination Notice (such period of Tenant’s “post-Continuous Outage termination tenancy” is referred to
              herein as “Tenant’s Continuous Outage Termination Period”); provided, however, that, (a) during Tenant’s Continuous
              Outage Termination Period, all of the terms of this Lease shall continue in full force and effect (including the default and
              remedy provisions contained herein), and (b) Tenant shall have the right to terminate Tenant’s Continuous Outage Termination
              Period, prior to the one hundred eightieth (180th) day thereof, by providing ninety (90) days’ written notice of such early
              termination to Landlord (“Tenant’s 2nd Continuous Outage Termination Notice”), in which case Tenant’s Continuous Outage
              Termination Period shall expire upon the earlier to occur of (i) the one hundred eightieth (180th) day after the date of Landlord’s
              receipt of Tenant’s Continuous Outage Termination Notice; and (ii) the ninetieth (90th) day after the date of Landlord’s receipt
              of Tenant’s 2nd Continuous Outage Termination Notice. Tenant’s failure to timely deliver Tenant’s Continuous Outage
              Termination Notice shall automatically extinguish Tenant’s right to terminate this Lease with respect to that particular
              Continuous Outage. As used herein the term “Continuous Outage” means an Interruption of Landlord’s Services occurs and
              continues for thirty (30) consecutive days, regardless of whether or not such Interruption of Landlord’s Services was caused by
              Force Majeure.
