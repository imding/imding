                     20.       ESTOPPEL, ATTORNMENT AND SUBORDINATION.
                               20.1      Estoppel. Within ten (10) business days after written request by Landlord,
                                         Tenant shall execute and deliver a commercially reasonable certificate to those
                                         parties as are reasonably requested by Landlord (including a Mortgagee or
                                         prospective purchaser). Without limitation, such estoppel certificate may include
                                         a certification as to the status of this Lease, the existence of any Event of
                                         Defaults and the amount of Rent that is due and payable. Tenant's failure to
                                         deliver said statement in such time period shall be an Event of Default hereunder
                                         and shall be conclusive upon Tenant that (1) this Lease is in full force and effect,





                                         without modification except as may be represented by Landlord; (2) there are no
                                         uncured Event of Defaults in Landlord's performance and Tenant has no right of
                                         offset, counterclaim or deduction against Rent hereunder; and (3) no more than
                                         one month's Base Rent has been paid in advance.
                               20.2      Subordination. This Lease shall unconditionally be and at all times remain
                                         subject and subordinate to all ground leases, master leases and all mortgages and
                                         deeds of trust which now or hereafter affect the Premises, or the Project or
                                         Landlord's interest therein (including any modifications, renewals or extensions
                                         thereof and all amendments thereto) (collectively, referred to as a “Mortgage”),
                                         all without the necessity of Tenant's executing further instruments to effect such
                                         subordination. The party having the benefit of a Mortgage shall be referred to as
                                         a “Mortgagee”. If requested, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Landlord
                                         within ten (10) days after Landlord's request whatever documentation that may
                                         reasonably be required to further effect the provisions of this paragraph
                                         including a Subordination, Nondisturbance and Attornment Agreement
                                         ("SNDA") in the form reasonably required by the applicable Mortgagee.
                                         Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, (1) the
                                         obligation

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                            24





                                         for commissions under Section 25.19 shall not be binding on, and will not be
                                         enforceable against, any of Owner's Mortgagees, and (2) such commission
                                         obligation shall be unconditionally subordinate to the lien of any Mortgage, and
                                         any commissions otherwise payable under this Lease shall not be due or payable
                                         after an event of default under any such mortgage or other security interest.
                                         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 20.2, the
                                         holder of any such Mortgage may at any time subordinate its Mortgage to this
                                         Lease, without Tenant’s consent, by notice in writing to Tenant, and thereupon
                                         this Lease shall be deemed prior to such Mortgage without regard to their
                                         respective dates of executing, delivery or recording and in the event such
                                         Mortgagee shall have the same rights with respect to this Lease as though this
                                         Lease has been executed prior to the executing, delivery and recording of such
                                         Mortgage and had been assigned to such Mortgagee.
                               20.3      Attornment. Tenant hereby agrees that Tenant will recognize as its landlord
                                         under this Lease and shall attorn to any person succeeding to the interest of
                                         Landlord in respect of the land and the buildings governed by this Lease upon
                                         any foreclosure of any Mortgage upon such land or buildings or upon the
                                         execution of any deed in lieu of foreclosure in respect to such Mortgage. Tenant
                                         shall pay all rental payments required to be made pursuant to the terms of this
                                         Lease for the duration of the term of this Lease. Tenant’s attornment shall be
                                         effective and self-operative without the execution of any further instrument
                                         immediately upon Mortgagee’s succeeding Landlord’s interest in this Lease and
                                         giving written notice thereof to Tenant. If requested, Tenant shall execute and
                                         deliver an instrument or instruments confirming its attornment as provided for
                                         herein; provided, however, that no such Mortgagee or successor- in-interest shall
                                         be bound by any payment of Base Rent for more than one (1) month in advance,
                                         or any amendment or modification of this Lease made without the express
                                         written consent of such Mortgagee where such consent is required under
                                         applicable loan documents. Mortgagee shall not be liable for, nor subject to, any
                                         offsets or defenses which Tenant may have by reason of any act or omission of
                                         Landlord under this Lease, nor for the return of any sums which Tenant may
                                         have paid to Landlord under this Lease as and for security deposits, advance
                                         rentals or otherwise, except to the extent that such sums are actually delivered by
                                         Landlord to Mortgagee. If Mortgagee, by succeeding to the interest of Landlord
                                         under this Lease, should become obligated to perform the covenants of Landlord
                                         hereunder, then, upon, any further transfer of Landlord’s interest by Mortgagee,
                                         all such obligations shall terminate as to Mortgagee.
                     21.       LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
                               CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS LEASE, THE LIABILITY OF LANDLORD
                               (AND OF ANY SUCCESSOR LANDLORD) SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER
                               OF (A) THE INTEREST OF LANDLORD IN THE BUILDING, OR (B) THE EQUITY
                               INTEREST LANDLORD WOULD HAVE IN THE BUILDING IF THE BUILDING
                               WERE ENCUMBERED BY THIRD PARTY DEBT IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO
                               70% OF THE VALUE OF THE BUILDING. TENANT SHALL LOOK SOLELY TO
                               LANDLORD’S INTEREST IN THE BUILDING FOR THE RECOVERY OF ANY





                               JUDGMENT OR AWARD AGAINST LANDLORD OR ANY LANDLORD
                               INDEMNITEES. NEITHER LANDLORD NOR ANY LANDLORD INDEMNITEES
                               SHALL BE PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR ANY JUDGMENT OR DEFICIENCY, AND
                               IN NO EVENT SHALL LANDLORD OR ANY LANDLORD INDEMNITEES OR
                               MORTGAGEES BE LIABLE TO TENANT FOR LOST PROFIT, DAMAGE TO OR
                               LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANY FORM OF SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
                               CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE. BEFORE FILING SUIT FOR AN ALLEGED
                               DEFAULT BY LANDLORD, TENANT SHALL GIVE LANDLORD AND THE
                               MORTGAGEE(S) WHOM TENANT HAS BEEN NOTIFIED HOLD MORTGAGES,
                               NOTICE AND REASONABLE TIME TO CURE THE ALLEGED DEFAULT.
                               WHENEVER LANDLORD TRANSFERS ITS INTEREST, LANDLORD SHALL BE
                               AUTOMATICALLY RELEASED FROM FURTHER PERFORMANCE UNDER THIS
                               LEASE AND FROM ALL FURTHER LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES HEREUNDER
                               AND THE TRANSFEREE OF LANDLORD’S INTEREST SHALL ASSUME ALL
                               LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF LANDLORD HEREUNDER FROM THE
                               DATE OF SUCH TRANSFER.
