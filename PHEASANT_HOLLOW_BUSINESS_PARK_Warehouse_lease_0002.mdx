1. `PREMISES`

2.01           Premises and Project:     In consideration of the rents, covenants and agreements contained herein, Landlord leases to Tenant, and Tenant leases from Landlord the Premises, together with such rights of ingress and egress over and across the Project and the Building that are reasonably necessary for the use of the Premises, together with the right to use all Common Areas.  The Premises will initially contain approximately 41,252 square feet.  If Tenant elects, in its sole and absolute discretion, to cause the construction of a mezzanine as provided in Section 7.02 of this Lease, then the Premises will be increased by the size of the new mezzanine.  Regardless of whether or not Tenant exercises its option to cause the construction of a mezzanine, the Minimum Base Rent shall be as provided in the Fundamental Lease Provisions and in Section 1 of this Lease; however, if Tenant elects to add a mezzanine to the Premises, for the purposes of calculating Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the Operating Expenses as described in Section 5.01 of this Lease, the square footage of the Premises and the Building shall be increased by the square footage of the mezzanine.

2.02           Determination of Square Footage:     The square footage of the Premises, the Building, and other buildings in the Project shall be determined by measuring from the outside of exterior walls, except that such measuring shall be from the center of those walls which are shared in common by adjacent tenants.

2.03           Tenant’s Access to Premises:           Throughout the Term, Tenant will have access to all of the Premises, and all of the Common Areas of the Building, necessary for operation of the Premises twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week.

The Early Termination notice must be submitted to Landlord and will obligate Tenant to pay a termination fee within fifteen (15) days of delivery.  The early termination fee will be equal to the amount corresponding to the month of intended departure and shown under the column titled “Total Early Termination Fee” in the table below:

Minimum Base Rent is due in advance on the first day of each calendar month during the Term.  Minimum Base Rent for any partial month shall be prorated on a per-diem basis.  If the Rent Commencement Date is a day other than the first day of a calendar month, then upon the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant will pay to Landlord, as Minimum Base Rent for the partial month, a pro rata portion of Minimum Base Rent payable for a full month, based on the number of days in the month from Rent Commencement Date to the end of the month.

4.02           Late Penalty:     Minimum Base Rent and any additional Rent is due on the 1st of each month.  Any payment of Rent received after the 7th business day of each month shall incur a late penalty of 5% of the overdue amount plus interest on the unpaid balance of 12% per annum.  Tenant shall have 10 business days from receipt of invoice to pay any other “Non Rent” related invoices.
