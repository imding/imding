                     16.       DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION. If at any time during the Term all or a portion of the
                               Premises are damaged by a fire or other casualty, Landlord shall notify Tenant within
                               sixty (60) days after Landlord becomes aware of such damage as to the amount of time
                               Landlord reasonably estimates it will take to restore the Premises. If the restoration time
                               is estimated to exceed one hundred (100) days from the issuance of all permits, subject
                               to extensions for Force Majeure, Landlord or Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease. In
                               addition, Landlord, by notice to Tenant within ninety (90) days after the date of the fire
                               or other casualty shall have the right to terminate this lease if: (1) any Mortgagee
                               requires that the insurance proceeds be applied to the payment of the mortgage debt or
                               ground lease, or (2) a material uninsured loss to the Building or Premises occurs. If
                               neither party either elects to terminate this Lease as provided above or if neither party
                               has the right to terminate this Lease as provided above, then, subject to receipt of
                               sufficient insurance proceeds, Landlord shall promptly commence to restore the
                               Premises, subject to delays arising from the collection of insurance proceeds or from
                               Force Majeure events. Such restoration shall be to substantially the same condition that
                               existed prior to the fire or other casualty, except for modifications required by Applicable
                               Laws. Upon notice from Landlord, Tenant shall assign or endorse over to Landlord (or to
                               any party designated by Landlord) all property insurance proceeds payable to Tenant
                               under Tenant insurance with respect to any Alterations, provided if the estimated cost to
                               repair such Alterations exceeds the amount of insurance proceeds received by Landlord
                               from Tenant’s insurance carrier, the excess cost of such repairs shall be paid by Tenant to
                               Landlord prior to Landlord’s commencement of repairs or Tenant may determine not to
                               restore such Alterations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this
                               Lease if the Premises are damaged during the last year of the Term and Landlord
                               reasonably estimates that it will take more than three (3) months to repair such damage.
                               Provided no Event of Default by Tenant has occurred, Base Rent and Tenant’s
                               Proportionate Share, or Tenant’s Project Share, of Operating Expenses and Real Property
                               Taxes shall be abated for the period of repair and restoration commencing on the date of
                               such casualty event in the proportion which the area of the Premises, if any, which is
                               untenantable bears to the total area of the Premises. Such abatement shall be the sole
                               remedy of Tenant. Tenant agrees that the terms of this Section 16 shall govern any





                               damage or destruction and shall accordingly supersede any contrary statute or rule of
                               law.
                     17.       CONDEMNATION. If any part of the Premises or the Building should be taken for any
                               public or quasi-public use under governmental law, ordinance, or regulation, or by right
                               of eminent domain, or by private purchase in lieu thereof (a "Taking" or "Taken"), and
                               the Taking would materially interfere with or impair Landlord's ownership or operation
                               of the Property and/or the Project (as determined by Landlord) or the Tenant’s use and
                               operation of the Premises, Building or Project, then upon written notice by Landlord this
                               Lease shall terminate and Base Rent and Tenant’s Proportionate Share and Tenant’s
                               Project Share of Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes shall be apportioned as of
                               said date. If part of the Premises or the Building shall be Taken and such condemnation
                               does not materially interfere with or impair Landlord’s ownership or operation of the
                               Property and/or the Project or the Tenant’s use and operation of the Premises, Building
                               or Project, and this Lease is not terminated as provided above, the Base Rent and
                               Tenant’s Proportionate Share and Tenant’s Project Share of Operating Expenses and Real
                               Property Taxes payable hereunder during the unexpired Term shall be reduced to account
                               for any reduction in the square footage of the Premises, Building or Project, as

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                            19





                               applicable. In the event of any such Taking, Landlord shall be entitled to receive the
                               entire price or award from any such Taking without any payment to Tenant, and Tenant
                               hereby assigns to Landlord Tenant's interest, if any, in such award. Tenant shall have the
                               right, to the extent that same shall not diminish Landlord's award, to make a separate
                               claim against the condemning authority (but not Landlord) for such compensation as
                               may be separately awarded or recoverable by Tenant for moving expenses and damage to
                               Tenant's trade fixtures, if a separate award for such items is made to Tenant. If only a
                               part of the Premises is subject to a Taking and this Lease is not terminated, Landlord,
                               with reasonable diligence, will restore the remaining portion of the Premises as nearly as
                               practicable to the condition immediately prior to the Taking. Tenant agrees that the terms
                               of this Section 17 shall govern any Taking and shall accordingly supersede any contrary
                               statute or rule of law.
