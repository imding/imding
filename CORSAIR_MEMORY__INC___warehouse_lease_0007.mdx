              12. ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS
                   (a) Tenant shall not make, or permit to be made, any alteration, addition or improvement (hereinafter referred to
              individually as an “Alteration” and collectively as the “Alterations”) to the Premises or any part thereof without
              the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that
              Landlord shall have the right in its sole and absolute discretion to consent or to withhold its consent to any
              Alteration which affects the structural portions of the Premises, the Building or the Project or the Systems serving
              the Premises, the Building and/or the Project or any portion thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
              Landlord’s approval shall not be required for Alterations to the interior of the Premises, provided that such
              Alterations (1) do not cost in excess of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) in any twelve (12) month period,
              (2) do not affect or require work to be performed on the structural portions of the Building or the Systems serving
              the Premises and/or the Building or any portion thereof, (3) do not require the issuance of a building or other
              governmental permit, authorization or approval, (4) do not require work to be performed in portions of the Building
              outside the Premises in order to comply with applicable Laws, and (5) are consistent with Landlord’s Building
              standards in effect at the time of installation of the Alterations (“Minor Alterations”). All references in this Lease to
              “Alterations” shall mean and include Minor Alterations, unless specified to the contrary.

                   (b) Any Alteration to the Premises shall be at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, in compliance with all applicable
              Laws and all requirements requested by Landlord, including, without limitation, the requirements of any insurer
              providing coverage for the Premises or the Project or any part thereof, and in accordance with plans and
              specifications approved in writing by Landlord, and shall be constructed and installed by a contractor approved in
              writing by Landlord. In connection with any Alterations, Tenant shall deliver plans and specifications therefor to
              Landlord for Landlord’s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If
              Landlord disapproves of proposed plans or specifications, Landlord



              shall provide in writing the grounds for such disapproval. As a further condition to giving consent, Landlord may
              require Tenant to provide Landlord, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, a payment and performance bond in form
              reasonably acceptable to Landlord, in a principal amount not less than one and one-half times the estimated costs of
              such Alterations, to ensure Landlord against any liability for mechanic’s and materialmen’s liens and to ensure
              completion of work. Before Alterations may begin, valid building permits or other permits or licenses required must
              be furnished to Landlord, and, once the Alterations begin, Tenant will diligently and continuously pursue their
              completion. Landlord may monitor construction of the Alterations and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for its costs
              (including, without limitation, the costs of any construction manager retained by Landlord) in reviewing plans and
              documents and in monitoring construction. Tenant shall maintain during the course of construction, at its sole cost
              and expense, builders’ risk insurance for the amount of the completed value of the Alterations on an all-risk non-
              reporting form covering all improvements under construction, including building materials, and other insurance in
              amounts and against such risks as Landlord shall reasonably require in connection with the Alterations. In addition
              to and without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, Tenant shall ensure that its contractor(s) procure and
              maintain in full force and effect during the course of construction a “broad form” commercial general liability and
              property damage policy of insurance naming Landlord, Tenant, Landlord’s Investment Advisers, any property
              manager designated by Landlord and Landlord’s lenders as additional insureds. The minimum limit of coverage of
              the aforesaid policy shall be in the amount of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) for injury or death
              of one person in any one accident or occurrence and in the amount of not less than Two Million Dollars
              ($2,000,000.00) for injury or death of more than one person in any one accident or occurrence, and shall contain a
              severability of interest clause or a cross liability endorsement. Such insurance shall further insure Landlord and
              Tenant against liability for property damage of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00).

                   (c) All Alterations, including, but not limited to, heating, lighting, electrical, air conditioning, fixed partitioning,
              window coverings, wall covering and paneling, built-in cabinet work and carpeting installations made by Tenant,
              together with all property that has become an integral part of the Premises or the Building, shall at once be and
              become the property of Landlord, and shall not be deemed trade fixtures or Tenant’s Property. If requested by
              Landlord, Tenant will pay, prior to the commencement of construction, an amount determined by Landlord
              necessary to cover the costs of demolishing such Alterations and/or the cost of returning the Premises and the
              Building to its condition prior to such Alterations.

                   (d) All telephone systems and/or other related computer or telecommunications equipment or lines must be
              installed by Tenant within the Premises, although such installations do not require Landlord’s consent, and, at the
              request of Landlord made at any time prior to the expiration of the Term, removed upon the expiration or sooner
              termination of this Lease and the Premises restored to the same condition as before such installation.

                   (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, before installing any equipment or lights which generate an
              undue amount of heat in the Premises (i.e., in excess of the heat load for which the existing HVAC system was
              designed), or if Tenant plans to use any high-power usage equipment in the Premises (i.e., in excess of the electrical
              load for which the existing electrical system was designed), Tenant shall obtain the written permission of Landlord,
              which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Landlord may refuse to


              grant such permission unless Tenant agrees to pay the costs to Landlord for installation of supplementary air
              conditioning capacity or electrical systems necessitated by such equipment.

                  (f) Tenant agrees not to proceed to make any Alterations, notwithstanding consent from Landlord to do so, until
              Tenant notifies Landlord in writing of the date Tenant desires to commence construction or installation of such
              Alterations and Landlord has approved such date in writing, in order that Landlord may post appropriate notices to
              avoid any liability to contractors or material suppliers for payment for Tenant’s improvements. Tenant will at all
              times permit such notices to be posted and to remain posted until the completion of work.

                  (g) Tenant shall not, at any time prior to or during the Term, directly or indirectly employ, or permit the
              employment of, any contractor, mechanic or laborer in the Premises, whether in connection with any Alteration or
              otherwise, if it is reasonably foreseeable that such employment will materially interfere or cause any material
              conflict with other contractors, mechanics, or laborers engaged in the construction, maintenance or operation of the
              Project by Landlord, Tenant or others. In the event of any such interference or conflict, Tenant, upon demand of
              Landlord, shall cause all contractors, mechanics or laborers causing such interference or conflict to leave the Project
              immediately.
