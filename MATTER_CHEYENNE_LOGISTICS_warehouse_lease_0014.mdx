
                     22.       HOLDING OVER. If Tenant holds over the Premises or any part thereof after
                               expiration of the Term, such holding over shall be a tenancy at sufferance only, for the
                               entire Premises, subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease, provided that, Tenant
                               shall pay monthly Base Rent and Additional Rent (determined on a per month basis
                               without reduction for partial months during the holdover) equal to one hundred fifty
                               percent (150%) of the Base Rent and Additional Rent in effect immediately prior to such
                               holding over. This Section shall not be construed as Landlord's permission for Tenant to
                               hold over. Acceptance of Rent by Landlord following expiration or termination shall not
                               constitute a renewal of this Lease or extension of the Term except as specifically set
                               forth above. If Tenant fails to surrender the Premises upon expiration or earlier
                               termination of this Lease, and if such failure continues for more than ninety (90) days
                               after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall indemnify and hold
                               Landlord harmless from and against all Losses (including without limitation
                               consequential damages) resulting from or arising out of Tenant's failure to surrender the
                               Premises, including, but not limited to, any amounts required to be paid to any tenant or
                               prospective tenant who was to have occupied the Premises after the expiration or earlier
                               termination of this Lease and any related attorneys' fees and brokerage commissions.
                     23.       NOTICES. All demands, approvals, consents or notices (collectively referred to as a
                               “notice”) shall be in writing and delivered by hand or sent by registered, express, or
                               certified mail, with return receipt requested or with delivery confirmation requested from
                               the U.S. postal service, or sent by overnight or same day courier service at the party’s
                               respective Notice Address(es) set forth in Section 1; provided, however, notices sent by
                               Landlord regarding general Building operational matters may be sent via e-mail to the e-
                               mail address provided by Tenant to Landlord for such purpose. In addition, if the
                               Building is closed (whether due to emergency, governmental order or any other reason),
                               then any notice address at the Building shall not be deemed a required notice address
                               during such closure, and, unless Tenant has provided an alternative valid notice address
                               to Landlord for use during such closure, any notices sent during such closure may be
                               sent via e-mail or in any other practical manner reasonably designed to ensure receipt by
                               the intended recipient. Each notice shall be deemed to have been received on the earlier
                               to occur of actual delivery or the date on which delivery is refused, or, if Tenant has
                               vacated the Premises or any other Notice Address of Tenant without providing a new
                               Notice Address, 3 days after notice is deposited in the U.S. mail or with a courier service
                               in the manner described above. Either party may, at any time, change its Notice Address
                               (other than to a post office box address) by giving the other party written notice of the
                               new address.
                     24.       SURRENDER. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, subject to the
                               normal wear and tear of the Premises, Tenant shall repair any damage to and restore the
                               condition of the Premises in accordance with Section 13.2. Tenant shall also remove all
                               of Tenant's Property and shall repair all damage to the Premises, the Building, the
                               Common Area, and the Project caused by the installation or removal of Tenant's
                               Property. In no event shall Tenant remove from the Building any mechanical or electrical
                               systems, including without limitation, any power wiring or power panels, lighting or





                               lighting fixtures, wall coverings, drapes, blinds or other window coverings, carpets or
                               other floor coverings, heaters, air conditioners or any other heating and air conditioning
                               equipment, fencing or security gates, load levelers, dock lights, dock locks or dock seals,
                               or any wiring or any other aspect of any systems within the Premises, unless Landlord
                               specifically permits or requires such removal in writing. Tenant shall surrender the
                               Premises, together with all keys and security codes, to Landlord broom clean, in as good
                               a condition as when received, and in the condition described on Exhibit H attached
                               hereto, ordinary wear and tear and damage by fire or casualty excepted. Conditions
                               existing because of Tenant's failure to perform maintenance, repairs or replacements
                               shall not be deemed "reasonable wear and tear”. If Tenant fails to remove any of Tenant’s
                               Property, or to restore the Premises to the required condition, within five (5) days after
                               termination of this Lease or Tenant’s right to possession, Landlord, at Tenant’s sole cost
                               and expense, shall be entitled (but not obligated) to remove and store Tenant’s Property
                               and/or perform such restoration of the Premises. Landlord shall not be responsible for
                               the value, preservation or safekeeping of Tenant’s Property, except for the negligence or
                               willful misconduct of Landlord, its agents or contractors. Tenant shall pay Landlord,
                               upon demand, the expenses and storage charges incurred. If Tenant fails to remove
                               Tenant’s Property from the Premises or storage,

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                            26





                               within 30 days after notice, Landlord may deem all or any part of Tenant’s Property to be
                               abandoned and, at Landlord’s option, title to Tenant’s Property shall vest in Landlord or
                               Landlord may dispose of Tenant’s Property in any manner Landlord deems appropriate.
