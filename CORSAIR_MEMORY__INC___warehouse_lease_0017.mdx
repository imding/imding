28. TAXES
                   Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay, prior to delinquency, all taxes levied against Tenant’s Property. If any
              Alteration installed by Tenant or any of Tenant’s Property pursuant to Paragraph 12 is assessed and taxed with the
              Project or Building, Tenant shall pay such taxes to Landlord within ten (10) days after delivery to Tenant of a
              statement therefor.

              29. EFFECT OF CONVEYANCE
                   The term “Landlord” as used in this Lease means, from time to time, the then current owner of the Building or
              the Project containing the Premises, so that, in the event of any sale of the Building or the Project, Landlord shall be
              and hereby is entirely freed and relieved of all covenants and obligations of Landlord hereunder, and it shall be
              deemed and construed, without further agreement between the parties and the purchaser at any such sale, that the
              purchaser of the Building or the Project has assumed and agreed to carry out any and all covenants and obligations
              of Landlord hereunder.



              30. TENANT’S ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE
                    From time to time, upon written request of Landlord, Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to
              Landlord or its designee an Estoppel Certificate in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E and with any
              other statements reasonably requested by Landlord or its designee. Any such Estoppel Certificate may be relied
              upon by a prospective purchaser of Landlord’s interest or a mortgagee of (or holder of a deed of trust encumbering)
              Landlord’s interest or assignee of any mortgage or deed of trust upon Landlord’s interest in the Premises. If Tenant
              fails to provide such certificate within ten (10) business days of receipt by Tenant of a written request by Landlord
              as herein provided, such failure shall, at Landlord’s election, constitute a Default under this Lease, and Tenant shall
              be deemed to have given such certificate as above provided without modification and shall be deemed to have
              admitted the accuracy of any information supplied by Landlord to a prospective purchaser or mortgagee or deed of
              trust holder.

              31. SUBORDINATION
                   At the option of Landlord, this Lease, and all rights of Tenant hereunder, are and shall be subject and
              subordinate to all ground leases, overriding leases and underlying leases affecting the Building or the Project now or
              hereafter existing and each of the terms, covenants and conditions thereto (the “Superior Lease(s)”), and to all
              mortgages or deeds of trust which may now or hereafter affect the Building, the Property or any of such leases and
              each of the terms, covenants and conditions thereto (the “Superior Mortgage(s)”), whether or not such mortgages
              or deeds of trust shall also cover other lands, buildings or leases, to each and every advance made or hereafter to be
              made under such mortgages or deeds of trust, and to all renewals, modifications, replacements and extensions of
              such leases and such mortgages or deeds of trust and spreaders and consolidations of such mortgages or deeds of
              trust. This Paragraph shall be self-operative and no further instrument of subordination shall be required.

                   Tenant shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any reasonable instrument that Landlord, the lessor
              under any such lease or the holder of any such mortgage or deed of trust or any of their respective successors in
              interest may reasonably request to evidence such subordination; if Tenant fails to execute, acknowledge or deliver
              any such instrument within ten (10) business days after request therefor, Tenant hereby irrevocably constitutes and
              appoints Landlord as Tenant’s attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, to execute and deliver any such instrument
              for and on behalf of Tenant. As used herein the lessor of a Superior Lease or its successor in interest is herein called
              “Superior Lessor”; and the holder of a Superior Mortgage is herein called “Superior Mortgagee.”

                   If any Superior Lessor or Superior Mortgagee shall succeed to the rights of Landlord under this Lease, whether
              through possession or foreclosure action or delivery of a new lease or deed (such party so succeeding to Landlord’s
              rights herein called “Successor Landlord”), then Tenant shall attorn to and recognize such Successor Landlord as
              Tenant’s landlord under this Lease (without the need for further agreement) and shall promptly execute and deliver
              any reasonable instrument that such Successor Landlord may reasonably request to evidence such attornment. This
              Lease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between the Successor Landlord and Tenant upon all of
              the terms, conditions and covenants as are set forth in

 

              this Lease, except that the Successor Landlord shall not (a) be liable for any previous act or omission of Landlord
              under this Lease, except to the extent such act or omission shall constitute a continuing Landlord default hereunder;
              (b) be subject to any offset, not expressly provided for in this Lease; or (c) be bound by any previous modification of
              this Lease or by any previous prepayment of more than one month’s Base Rent, unless such modification or
              prepayment shall have been expressly approved in writing by the Successor Landlord (or predecessor in interest).

                   Landlord represents and warrants to Tenant that as of the date of this Lease, there are no Superior Leases or
              Superior Mortgages encumbering all or any portion of the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
              this Paragraph 31, if a Superior Lease or Superior Mortgage is hereafter placed against all or any portion of the
              Premises, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to obtain an agreement from the holder thereof, whereby the holder
              of such Superior Lease or Superior Mortgage agrees that Tenant, upon paying the Base Rent and all of the
              Additional Rent herein provided for, and observing and complying with the covenants, agreements and conditions of
              this Lease on its part to be observed and complied with, shall lawfully and quietly hold, occupy and enjoy the
              Premises during the Term of this Lease (including any exercised renewal term), without hindrance or interference
              from anyone claiming by or through said Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor and that said Superior Mortgagee
              or Superior Lessor, upon succeeding to Landlord’s interest in the Premises and the Lease, shall observe and comply
              with all of Landlord’s duties under this Lease (subject to limitations and exclusions customarily required by Superior
              Lessors or Superior Mortgagees). Tenant shall bear all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) of the holder of
              such future Superior Lease or Superior Mortgage in connection with any such non-disturbance agreement for the
              benefit of Tenant.
