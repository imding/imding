19.02           Events Permitting Cancellation by Landlord:     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if: (a) the Premises by reason of any such casualty are rendered wholly untenantable; or (b) the Premises are damaged as a result of a risk which is not covered by Landlord’s insurance; or (c) the Premises are damaged in whole or in part during the last eighteen (18) months of the Term; or (d) any or all of the Common Areas of the Building are damaged, whether or not the Premises are damaged, to such extent that the Building cannot, in the reasonable and good faith judgment of Landlord, be operated as a viable, integrated unit; or (e) Landlord’s mortgage requires that the insurance proceeds be applied against the principal balance due on Landlord’s mortgage, then and in any such event, Landlord may either elect to repair the damage or may cancel this Lease by notice of cancellation given to Tenant within ninety (90) days after such event and thereupon this Lease shall expire, and Tenant shall promptly (within thirty (30) days following such notice) vacate and surrender the Premises to Landlord.  Tenant’s liability for rent upon the termination of this Lease shall cease as of the day following the date of Landlord’s notice of cancellation.

19.03           Abatement of Rent:     In the event Landlord is required, or elects to repair any damage, it shall commence such repair within ninety (90) days of the casualty, diligently prosecute such to completion and, until such repair is complete, Minimum Base Rent and Tenant’s Proportionate Share shall xxxxx proportionately as to the portion of the Premises rendered untenantable.  Any such abatement of rent, however, shall end five (5) days after Landlord gives notice in good faith to Tenant that                                                                              Landlord’s responsibilities with regard to repairing the Premises have been completed.

19.04           Specific Responsibility of Each Party:     Unless this Lease is terminated by Landlord, Landlord shall repair and restore the Premises to substantially the condition in which the Premises were immediately prior to such damage or destruction and Tenant shall re-fixture and restock the Premises all in a manner and to a condition equal to that existing prior to the destruction or casualty.  In such event, the proceeds of all insurance carried by Landlord on the Building and carried by Tenant on its equipment, contents, personal property and fixtures shall be held in trust by each respective party for the purpose of said repair and replacement.  All repair and restoration work shall be done in substantial conformance with Exhibit “B” and Section 7 of this Lease except for any modifications to the design criteria or working drawings which are then required by governmental regulations or are mutually agreed to by the parties.  It is specifically understood that Landlord shall be responsible at its expense, for the building shell and for those items described on Exhibit “B” as being Landlord’s obligation and Tenant shall be responsible to repair or replace, at its expense, those items described on Exhibit “B” as Tenant’s obligation and those items subsequently constructed by Tenant pursuant to Section 7 and Tenant also shall be responsible for the replacement of its trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and stock in trade.  In the event of such restorations by the parties, that portion of the insurance proceeds that Landlord receives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      which are applicable to the permanent alterations, additions or improvements initially or subsequently constructed by Tenant (pursuant to Exhibit “B” or Section 7) shall be paid to Tenant less a pro rata portion of any deductible amount (retention) attributable to the loss in question and such payment shall be used by Tenant for such restoration.
