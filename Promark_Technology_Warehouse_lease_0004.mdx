9. **ALTERATIONS**. Tenant shall not make any alterations, additions or improvements to the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord, such consent with respect to non-structural interior alterations not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, may install trade fixtures as Tenant may deem necessary, so long as such trade fixtures do not penetrate or disturb the structural integrity and support provided by the roof, exterior walls or subfloors or require excavation of the floor slab or disturbance of column supports. All such trade fixtures, as well as any other alterations, additions or improvements made by Tenant with the aforesaid approval of Landlord, shall be constructed and/or installed by contractors approved by Landlord, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, in a good and workmanlike manner, and in compliance with all applicable governmental and quasi-governmental laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as all requirements of Landlord’s insurance carrier. If applicable, a list of Landlord’s pre-approved Tenant alterations, approved subject to review of Tenant drawings and compliance with the preceding provisions of this Section 9, is set forth on **Exhibit E**.

Other than the initial improvements to be made by Tenant incidental to Tenant’s initial occupancy of the Premises (hereby shown in Exhibit E and for purposes of this paragraph the “Tenant’s Initial Alterations”), then it is agreed that, subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall at Tenant’s sole expense remove all alterations, additions or improvements installed by Tenant within the Premises, including any materials other than paint which are applied to the columns, decking or joists, properly fill all holes in the floor and remove all above the floor improvements installed by Tenant, and upon such removal, Tenant shall at Tenant’s sole expense restore the Premises to a condition substantially similar to that condition when received by Tenant. However, notwithstanding the aforesaid, (i) upon Landlord’s written election, all or a portion of such alterations, additions and improvements shall revert to Landlord and shall remain within the Premises, and (ii) in the event that with respect to any alterations, additions and/or improvements other than the Tenant’s Initial Alterations, Tenant desires that said alterations, additions and/or improvements remain on the Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, at the time Tenant submits its request for Landlord’s consent to such alterations, additions and/or improvements, Tenant shall list those items which Tenant desires to remain on the Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, and Landlord shall within fifteen (15) days subsequent to the date of such request, notify Tenant whether it has agreed that such items shall remain on the Premises at the time of the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, and to the extent Landlord shall at that time not agree that such items shall remain on the Premises at the time of the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding clause (i), at the time of the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove all such alterations, additions and/or improvements in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sentence.

10. **DESTRUCTION.** If the Premises or the Total Property are damaged in whole or in part by casualty so as to render the Premises unusable for their intended purpose, and if the damages cannot be repaired within one hundred fifty (150) days from the date of said casualty, this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such casualty. If the damages can be repaired within said one hundred fifty (150) days, and Landlord does not elect within forty-five (45) days after the date of such casualty to repair the same, then either party may terminate this Lease by written notice served upon the other. In the event of any such termination, the parties shall have no further obligations to the other, except for those obligations accrued through the effective date of such casualty; and, upon such termination, Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord. Should Landlord elect to make such repairs, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, and Landlord shall proceed with all due diligence to repair and restore the Premises to a condition substantially similar to that condition which existed prior to such casualty. In the event the repair and restoration of the Premises extends beyond one hundred fifty (150) days after the date of such casualty due to causes beyond the control of Landlord, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, and Landlord shall not be liable therefor; but Landlord shall continue to complete such repairs and restoration with all due diligence. Tenant shall not be required to pay any Rent for any period in which the Premises are completely unusable for its intended purpose. In the event only a portion of the Premises are unusable for their intended purpose, Tenant’s Rent shall be equitably abated in proportion to that portion of the Premises which is so unfit. However, there shall be no Rent abatement if said damage is due to the fault or negligence of Tenant or Tenant’s agents, employees or invitees.
