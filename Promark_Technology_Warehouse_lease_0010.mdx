20. **MORTGAGES.** This Lease is subject and subordinated to any mortgages, deeds of trust or underlying leases, as well as to any extensions or modifications thereof (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Mortgages”), now of record or hereafter placed of record. In the event Landlord exercises its option to further subordinate this Lease, Tenant shall at the option of the holder of said Mortgage attorn to said holder. Any subordination shall be self-executing, but Tenant shall, at the written request of Landlord, execute such further assurances as Landlord deems desirable to confirm such subordination. In the event Tenant should fail or refuse to execute any instrument required under this Section, within ten (10) days after Landlord’s request, Landlord shall be granted a limited power of attorney to execute such instrument in the name of Tenant. In the event any existing or future lender holding a mortgage, deed of trust or other commercial paper requires a modification of this Lease which does not increase Tenant’s Rent hereunder, or does not materially change any obligation of Tenant hereunder, Tenant agrees to execute appropriate instruments to reflect such modification, upon request by Landlord.

21. **LIENS.** Tenant shall not mortgage or otherwise encumber or allow to be encumbered its interest herein without obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord. Should Tenant cause any mortgage, lien or other encumbrance (hereinafter singularly or collectively referred to as “Encumbrance”) to be filed against the Premises or the Total Property, Tenant shall dismiss or bond against the same within fifteen (15) days after the filing thereof. If Tenant fails to remove said Encumbrance within said fifteen (15) day period, Landlord shall have the absolute right to remove said Encumbrance by whatever measures Landlord shall deem convenient, including, without limitation, payment of such Encumbrance, in which event Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as Additional Rent, all costs expended by Landlord, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in removing said Encumbrance. All of the aforesaid rights of Landlord shall be in addition to any remedies which either Landlord or Tenant may have available to them at law or in equity.

22. **GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.** Landlord warrants that, to its actual knowledge, without any duty to investigate, the Premises were in compliance with all government regulations, building codes and laws at the time they were constructed. Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, shall conform with all laws and requirements of any Municipal, State or Federal authorities now in force, or which may hereafter be in force, pertaining, to or in connection with, Tenant’s occupancy of the Premises, including all requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991 (as may be amended). In addition, Tenant shall conform with any reasonable requirement of Landlord’s insurance carrier with respect to Tenant’s use of the Premises. The judgment of any court or an admission of Tenant in any action or proceeding at law, whether Landlord be a party thereto or not, shall be conclusive of the fact as between Landlord and Tenant.
