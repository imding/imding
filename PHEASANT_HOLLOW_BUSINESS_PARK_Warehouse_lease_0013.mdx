1. `ACCESS TO PREMISES`

Tenant agrees to permit Landlord and/or its authorized representatives to enter the Premises at all times during usual business hours on reasonable written notice to Tenant for the purpose of inspecting the same.  Tenant further covenants and agrees that Landlord or any person authorized by Landlord may enter upon the Premises during normal business hours, or after hours (with appropriate security measures), in order to make any necessary repairs to the Premises or perform work therein (provided that prior written notice has been given to Tenant and such repairs have been approved by Tenant): (i) which may be necessary to comply with any laws, ordinances, rules or regulations of any public authority, insurance agency or any similar body; (ii) which Landlord may deem necessary to prevent waste or deterioration in connection with the Premises if Tenant does not make those repairs which are its responsibility hereunder following written demand from Landlord; (iii) which may be necessary in an emergency situation; or (iv) which Landlord may deem necessary in the course of performing any remodeling, construction or other work in any portion of the Building, including without limitation the Premises of another tenant, adjacent to, above, or below the Premises.  Nothing herein contained shall imply any duty on the part of Landlord to do any such work which, under any provision of this Lease, Tenant may be required to do, nor shall it constitute a waiver of any Tenant default in failing to do the same.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, in any entry of the Premises, Landlord and its employees and contractors shall exercise good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with, or disturbance to Tenant or the operation of Tenant’s business in the Premises.

1. `OTHER TENANTS`

Landlord reserves the absolute right to effect such other tenancies in the Building as Landlord, in the exercise of its sole business judgment, shall determine to best promote the interests of, and Landlord’s ownership of, the Building.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall ensure that no other tenant in the Building or in the immediate vicinity of the Premises shall be allowed to engage in any trade or business which could be expected to expose Tenant’s inventory and/or operations to contamination in violation of certain pharmaceutical, EPA and/or FDA regulations.  Tenant does not rely on the fact, nor does Landlord represent, that any specific tenant or any specific business or any certain number of

tenants will occupy any space in the Building.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Landlord shall use its best efforts at all time to fill as soon as possible any vacancy which might occur.

1. `SUBORDINATION`

Upon written request of Landlord, Tenant will subordinate its rights hereunder to the lien of any mortgage or deed of trust or lien or other security interest resulting from any method of financing or refinancing, now or hereafter in force against the land and/or buildings comprising the Building and to all advances made on the strength of such security; provided however, that the holder of any such mortgage, deed of trust or other security interest shall agree not to disturb Tenant’s possession of the Premises so                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  long as Tenant is not in breach beyond any applicable cure periods of any of the terms and conditions of this Lease.  The provisions of this Section notwithstanding, so long as Tenant is not in default hereunder beyond any applicable cure periods, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect for the full term hereof and shall not be terminated as a result of any foreclosure or sale or transfer in lieu of such proceedings pursuant to a mortgage or other instrument to which Tenant has subordinated its rights pursuant hereto.

1. `ATTORNMENT`

In the event of the sale or assignment of Landlord’s interest in the Building, or in the event of any proceedings brought for the foreclosure of, or in the event of exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage, or other security instrument made by Landlord covering the Premises, Tenant shall attorn to the assignee or purchaser and recognize such purchaser as Landlord under this Lease.  Upon any termination, transfer or assignment of Landlord’s interest in the Premises, Tenant shall, attorn to the person or organization then holding title to the reversion of the Premises (the “Successor”) and to all subsequent Successors, and shall pay to the Successor all of the rents and other monies required to be paid by Tenant hereunder and perform all of the other terms, covenants, conditions and obligations in this Lease contained, and such Successor shall, on or before such termination, transfer or assignment,  execute and deliver to Tenant an instrument wherein such Successor agrees to assume the obligation of Landlord under this Lease and agrees that the tenancy of Tenant shall not be disturbed by such Successor.  In the event that the Mortgagee succeeds to the interest of Landlord hereunder and is advised by its counsel that all or any portion of the Base Rent or additional rent payable by Tenant hereunder is or may be deemed to be unrelated business income within the meaning of the United States Internal Revenue Code or regulations issued thereunder, Mortgagee, as Landlord, shall have the right at any time, from time to time, to notify Tenant in writing of the required changes to the Lease.  Tenant shall execute all documents necessary to effect any such amendment within thirty (30) days after written request from Mortgagee, as Landlord, provided that in no event shall such amendment increase Tenant’s payment obligations or other liability under this Lease, materially adversely affect Tenant’s rights under this Lease or reduce Landlord’s obligations hereunder.
