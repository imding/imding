ARTICLE 13
REMEDIES OF LANDLORD AND TENANT’S DEFAULT
The Landlord and Tenant further covenant and agree as follows:
13.1.	 	REMEDYING BY LANDLORD, NON-PAYMENT AND INTEREST

```
 	In addition to all rights and remedies of the Landlord available to it in the event of any default hereunder by the Tenant either by any other provision of this Lease or by statute or common law, the Landlord:
(a)	 	shall have the right (but shall not be obligated to) at all times to remedy or attempt to remedy any default of the Tenant, and in so doing may make any payments due or alleged to be due by the Tenant to third parties and may enter upon the Premises to do work or other things therein, and in such event all expenses of the Landlord in remedying or attempting to remedy such default shall be payable by the Tenant to the Landlord forthwith upon demand, together with a fee for supervision for carrying out the Tenant’s obligations in an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the cost of repairs or other work carried out by or under the supervision of the Landlord which amount shall be in addition to the incurred costs of such work together with interest at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum above the Prime Rate from time to time on the aggregate of the foregoing from the date funds were expended by the Landlord until actual payment thereof by the Tenant;

(b)	 	may recover as Additional Rent all sums paid or expenses incurred hereunder by the Landlord, which ought to have been paid or incurred by the Tenant, or for which the Landlord hereunder is entitled to reimbursement from the Tenant, and any interest owing to the Landlord hereunder by any and all remedies available to it for the recovery of Gross Rent in arrears;

(c)	 	if the Tenant shall fail to pay any Rent or other amount from time to time payable by it to the Landlord hereunder promptly when due, shall be entitled to interest thereon at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum above the Prime Rate from time to time from, except where interest commences to accrue earlier pursuant to Article 13.1(a), the date upon which the same was due until actual payment thereof.

```

13.2.	 	REMEDIES CUMULATIVE

```
 	The Landlord may from time to time resort to any or all of the rights and remedies available to it in the event of any default hereunder by the Tenant, either by any provision of this Lease or by statute or the general law, all of which rights and remedies are intended to be cumulative and not alternative, and the express provisions hereunder as to certain rights and remedies are not to be interpreted as excluding any other or additional rights and remedies available to the Landlord by statute or the general law.

```

13.3.	 	RIGHT OF RE-ENTRY ON TERMINATION

```
 	If this Lease shall have become terminated pursuant to any provision hereof, or if the Landlord shall have become entitled to terminate this Lease and shall have given notice terminating it pursuant to any provision hereof, then and in every such case it shall be lawful for the Landlord thereafter to enter into and upon the Premises or any part thereof in the name of the whole and the same to have again, repossess and enjoy as of its former estate.

```

13.4.	 	RE-ENTRY AND TERMINATION

```
 	If and whenever the Landlord becomes entitled to or does re-enter the Premises under any provision of this Lease, the Landlord, in addition to all other rights and remedies, shall have the right to terminate this Lease forthwith by leaving upon the Premises notice in writing of such termination, and in such event the Tenant shall forthwith vacate and surrender the Premises.

```

13.5.	 	RIGHTS ON RE-ENTRY

```
 	Whenever the Landlord becomes entitled to re-enter upon the Premises under any provision of this Lease, the Landlord in addition to all other rights it may have shall have the right to enter the Premises, as agent of the Tenant, either by force or otherwise without being liable for any loss or damage occasioned thereby and to relet them and to receive the rent therefor and as the agent of the Tenant to take possession of any furniture or other property thereon and to sell the same at public or private sale without notice and to apply the proceeds thereof and any rent derived from reletting the Premises, after deducting its costs of conducting such sale and its cost of reletting, upon account of the Rent due and to become due under this Lease and the Tenant shall be liable to the Landlord for the deficiency, if any.

```

13.6.	 	DISTRESS

```
 	The Tenant waives and renounces the benefit of any present or future law taking away or limiting the Landlord’s right of distress on the property of the Tenant and, notwithstanding any such law, the Landlord may seize and sell the Tenant’s goods and chattels, excepting for records and reports of a confidential nature, whether within the Premises or removed therefrom and apply the proceeds of such sale upon Rent and all other amounts outstanding including the cost of the seizure and sale in the same manner as might have been done if such law had not been passed. The Tenant further agrees that

```

- 29-

```
 	if it leaves the Premises leaving any Rent or other amounts provided to be paid under this Lease unpaid, the Landlord, in addition to any remedy otherwise provided at law or in equity, may seize the goods and chattels of the Tenant at any place to which the Tenant or any other person may have removed them from the Premises in the same manner as if such goods and chattels had remained upon the Premises. For the purposes of making any such distress the Landlord, by itself, its agents and bailiffs may break open any door or window and enter upon the Premises at any time after Rent or other monies shall accrue due.

```

13.7.	 	PAYMENT OF RENT, ETC., ON TERMINATION

```
 	If the Landlord shall re-enter and this Lease shall be terminated as provided for herein, then the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord on demand:
(a)	 	Rent up to the time of re-entry or termination whichever shall be the later plus accelerated Rent as herein provided;

(b)	 	all other amounts payable hereunder until such time;

(c)	 	such expenses as the Landlord may incur or have incurred in connection with re-entering or terminating and reletting, or collecting sums due or payable by the Tenant or realizing upon assets seized including brokerage, legal fees and disbursements (on a solicitor-client basis), and the expense of keeping the Premises in good order, repairing the same and preparing them for reletting; and

(d)	 	as liquidated damages for the loss of Rent and other income of the Landlord expected to be derived from the Lease during the period which would have constituted the unexpired portion of the Term had it not been terminated, the amount, if any, by which the rental value of the Premises for such period established by reference to the terms and provisions of this Lease exceeds the rental value of the Premises for such period established by reference to the terms and provisions upon which the Landlord relets them, if such reletting is accomplished within a reasonable time after termination of this Lease, and otherwise with reference to all market and other relevant circumstances. Rental value is to be computed in each case by reducing to present worth at an interest rate equal to the then current Prime Rate all Rent and other amounts to become payable for such period and where the ascertainment of amounts to become payable requires it, the Landlord may make estimates and assumptions of fact which shall govern unless shown to be unreasonable or erroneous.
