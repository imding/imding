The Appendices to this Agreement form an integral part thereof and any reference to this Agreement shall include a reference to the Appendices and vice versa.

The present Agreement replaces and annuls any agreement, communication, offer, proposal, or correspondence, oral or written, previously exchanged or concluded between the Parties and/or the Guarantor and referring to the same object.

23.2.Notwithstanding any provision contrary to the present Agreement, neither Party shall be liable for a delay or failure to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement arising from any cause beyond its reasonable control or arising from strikes, lockouts, work stoppages or other collective labour disputes, insofar that the Party invoking the force majeure informs the other Party as soon as reasonable possible of the occurrence and the estimated duration and the termination thereof, as well as an accurate description of the causes thereof. In case the situation of force majeure has a duration of one consecutive (1) month, the provisions of Article 12.2. of this Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis.

23.3.If one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is declared to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under the applicable law, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected. In the case whereby such invalid, illegal or unenforceable clause affects the entire nature of this Agreement, each of the Parties and - as the case may be - the Guarantor shall use its best efforts to immediately and in good faith negotiate a legally valid replacement provision which is economically equal to the affected clause.

23.4.No failure or delay of a Party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement shall be considered a final waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
