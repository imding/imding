33. **NOTICES TO MORTGAGEE.** Tenant agrees that a copy of any notice of default from Tenant to Landlord shall also be sent to the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust on the Premises; provided Tenant has been given written notice of the fact that such mortgage or deed of trust has been made and the address to which such notices shall be sent; and Tenant shall allow said mortgagee or holder of the deed of trust a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty (60) days from the receipt of said notice, to cure, or cause to be cured, any such default. If such default cannot reasonably be cured within the time specified herein, then such additional time as may be necessary shall be allowed, provided the curing of such default is commenced and diligently pursued (including, but not limited to, commencement of foreclosure proceedings if necessary to effect such cure), in which event this Lease shall not be terminated while such remedies are being thus diligently pursued.

34. **NON-WAIVER OF FUTURE ENFORCEMENT.** The receipt of rent or any part thereof by Landlord, with knowledge of any breach of this Lease by Tenant or of any default on the part of Tenant in the observance or performance of any of the conditions or covenants of this Lease, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any provisions of this Lease. No failure on the part of Landlord or of Tenant to enforce any covenant or provision herein contained nor any waiver of any right hereunder by Landlord or Tenant, shall discharge or invalidate such covenant or provision or affect the right of Landlord or Tenant to enforce the same in the event of any subsequent default. The receipt by Landlord of any rent or any sum of money or any other consideration hereunder paid by Tenant after the termination, in any manner, of the Term herein demised, or after the giving by Landlord of any notice hereunder to effect such termination, shall not reinstate, continue or extend the Term herein demised, or destroy or in any manner impair the efficacy of any such notice of termination as may have been given hereunder by Landlord to Tenant prior to the receipt of any such sum of money or other consideration, unless so agreed to in writing and signed by Landlord. Neither acceptance of the keys nor any other act or thing done by Landlord or any agent or employee during the term herein demised shall be deemed to be an acceptance of a surrender of said Leased Premises, excepting only an agreement in writing signed by Landlord accepting or agreeing to accept such surrender
