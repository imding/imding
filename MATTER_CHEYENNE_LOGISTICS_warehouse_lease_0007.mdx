                               12.1      Tenant Obligations. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 12.2,
                                         Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, shall keep and maintain the interior
                                         and exterior of the Premises in good, clean and safe order, condition and repair,
                                         including replacement (as necessary), including, without limitation, the
                                         following: loading docks, roll up doors and ramps; floors, subfloors and floor
                                         coverings; walls and wall coverings (excluding painting of exterior walls);
                                         doors, locks and other locking devices, windows, glass and plate glass; ceilings,
                                         and lighting systems; all plumbing, electrical and mechanical equipment and
                                         systems inside or exclusively serving the Premises; all heating, ventilating and
                                         air conditioning equipment and systems inside or exclusively serving the
                                         Premises (subject to Landlord's rights described below); and wiring, appliances
                                         and devices using or containing refrigerants, or otherwise attached to or part of
                                         Tenant's trade-fixtures and/or equipment. Tenant shall enter into a regularly
                                         scheduled preventive maintenance/service contract ("Service Contract") with a
                                         maintenance contractor reasonably acceptable to Landlord for servicing all
                                         heating ventilation, and air conditioning systems and equipment inside or
                                         exclusively serving the Premises (collectively, the "HVAC System"), if
                                         applicable, which Service Contract shall at a minimum comply with the
                                         requirements set forth on Exhibit I attached hereto. Tenant shall deliver full and
                                         complete copies of the Service Contract (and any other service contracts entered
                                         into by Tenant) to Landlord within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
                                         Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant fails to maintain
                                         a Service Contract as required by this Section 12.1, Landlord may elect to
                                         maintain the Service Contract, in which case Tenant shall reimburse Landlord
                                         within thirty (30) days after Landlord's demand for the reasonable and actual
                                         cost of the Service Contract and shall promptly undertake and complete the





                                         repairs and/or replacements recommended by such maintenance contractor
                                         during the Term of this Lease. All repairs and replacements by Tenant shall be
                                         made and performed: (1) at Tenant's cost and expense and at such time and in
                                         such manner as Landlord may reasonably designate, (2) by certified contractors
                                         or mechanics reasonably approved by Landlord, which such approval shall not
                                         be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (3) so that same shall be at least similar in
                                         quality, value and utility to the original work or installation, (4) in a manner and
                                         using equipment and materials that will not interfere with or impair the
                                         operations, use or occupation of the Building or any of the mechanical,
                                         electrical, plumbing or other systems in the Building, Property or the Project,
                                         and (5) in accordance with the Rules and Regulations and all Applicable Laws.
                                         In the event Tenant fails, in the reasonable judgment of Landlord, to maintain the
                                         Premises in accordance with the obligations under this Lease, which failure
                                         continues at the end of fifteen (15) business days following Tenant's receipt of
                                         written notice from Landlord stating the nature of the failure and Tenant has
                                         failed to commence a cure, or in the case of an emergency immediately without
                                         prior notice, Landlord shall have the right to enter the Premises and perform
                                         such maintenance, repairs or refurbishing at Tenant's sole cost and expense.

                                                                            13





                                         shall maintain written records of maintenance and repair and shall deliver copies
                                         thereof to Landlord upon request.
                               12.2      Landlord Obligations. Landlord shall assign all existing and continuing
                                         warranties associated with the Premises to Tenant to the extent permissible, and
                                         if not permissible, Landlord shall use its best efforts to enforce such warranties
                                         for the benefit of the Tenant. Landlord shall maintain and repair damage to
                                         structural portions of the roof, skylights (unless Tenant is directly responsible for
                                         damages to skylights), foundation and load-bearing portions of walls (excluding
                                         wall coverings, painting, glass and doors) of the Building and other portions of
                                         the buildings of the Project, and Landlord shall maintain and repair the Common
                                         Areas (as herein defined); provided, (a) if such damage is caused by an act or
                                         omission of Tenant, or any Tenant Party, then such repairs shall be at Tenant's
                                         sole expense and (b) Landlord shall not be required to make any repair resulting
                                         from (1) any alteration or modification to the Building or to mechanical
                                         equipment within the Building performed by, for or because of Tenant or to
                                         special equipment or systems installed by, for or because of Tenant, (2) the
                                         installation, moving, use or operation of Tenant's Property, (3) Tenant's use or
                                         occupancy of the Premises in violation of Section 15 of this Lease, (4) fire and
                                         other casualty, except as provided by Section 16 of this Lease, or (5)
                                         condemnation, except as provided in Section 17 of this Lease. Tenant waives any
                                         right to repair the Premises, the Building, the Project and/or the Common Area at
                                         the expense of Landlord under any Applicable Laws.

                               12.3      Landlord's Default. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease and specifically
                                         subject to Sections 3 and 21, if Landlord fails in the performance of any of
                                         Landlord’s obligations under this Lease and such failure continues for thirty (30)
                                         days after Landlord’s receipt of written notice thereof from Tenant (or an
                                         additional reasonable time after such receipt if (i) such failure cannot be cured
                                         within such thirty (30) day period, and (ii) Landlord commences curing such
                                         failure within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently pursues the
                                         curing of such failure), then Tenant shall be entitled to exercise any remedies
                                         that Tenant may have at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing,
                                         Landlord and Tenant agree that there are certain services which are to be
                                         performed by Landlord pursuant to this Lease and without which Tenant cannot
                                         occupy the Premises for the purpose of which it was originally leased. The
                                         services are (A) heat, water, gas, electricity, telephone and any other utilities and
                                         services used on or provided to the Premises or in the Building, including the
                                         repair and maintenance of mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and the
                                         heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems (to the extent that the
                                         delivery of such services is the obligation of Landlord pursuant to the terms of
                                         this Lease); (B) repairs and maintenance of the roof, roofing structure, skylights,
                                         exterior and structural walls, as well as the structural soundness of the
                                         foundation, including correcting defects of the same and/or replacing the same;
                                         and (C) continued access to the Building and Premises inclusive of the





                                         maintenance and repairs to the common driveways, loading and unloading areas
                                         and parking areas (collectively, the “Critical Services”). If Landlord fails to
                                         provide a Critical Service to the Premises or any portion thereof (a “Critical
                                         Service Failure”) within the stated period in this Section after receipt of written
                                         notice from Tenant (but in no event earlier than five (5) business days after
                                         receipt of such notice except in cases where there is an immediate threat of
                                         material and substantial property damage or immediate threat of bodily injury, in
                                         which case such shorter period of time as is reasonable under the circumstances),
                                         then Tenant may, at its option and without limiting all other available remedies,
                                         unless Landlord commences to cure such Critical Service Failure within such
                                         five (5) business day period (or immediately, in the case of an immediate threat
                                         or material and substantial property damage or immediate threat of bodily harm)
                                         and proceeds diligently to complete such cure, proceed to undertake such repairs
                                         and/or maintenance upon delivery of an additional two (2) business days' notice
                                         to Landlord that Tenant is taking such required action (provided, however, that
                                         no additional notice shall be required in the event of an emergency which
                                         threatens life or where there is imminent danger to property). If such Critical
                                         Service Failure is not cured prior to the expiration of such two (2) business day
                                         period (or the initial

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                            14





                                         notice and repair period set forth above in the event of emergencies where no
                                         second notice is required) (the "Outside Repair Period"), then Tenant shall be
                                         entitled to reimbursement by Landlord of Tenant's actual, reasonable (under the
                                         circumstances), and documented costs and expenses in performing such
                                         maintenance and/or repairs plus an amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of
                                         such costs for overhead and time of Tenant to manage and undertake Landlord's
                                         obligations. Such reimbursement shall be made within thirty (30) days after
                                         Landlord's receipt of Tenant's invoice of such costs and expenses. Any amounts
                                         not reimbursed by Landlord within such thirty (30) day period will be assessed a
                                         late charge equal to five percent (5%) of such delinquent sum and such
                                         delinquent sum shall also bear interest from the date such amount was due until
                                         paid in full at the lesser of (i) fifteen percent (15%) per annum; or (ii) at the
                                         Applicable Interest Rate until paid by Landlord. In the event Tenant undertakes
                                         such repairs and/or maintenance, and such work will affect the Building’s
                                         structure or Building’s systems, Tenant shall use only those unrelated third party
                                         contractors used by Landlord in the Building for such work unless such
                                         contractors are unwilling or unable to perform such work at competitive prices,
                                         in which event Tenant may utilize the services of any other qualified contractor
                                         which normally and regularly performs similar work in comparable first-class
                                         buildings in Clark County, Nevada. Tenant shall comply with the other terms and
                                         conditions of this Lease if Tenant takes the required action, except that Tenant is
                                         not required to obtain Landlord's consent for such repairs. TENANT SHALL
                                         INDEMNIFY AND DEFEND THE LANDLORD PARTIES AND OTHER
                                         TENANTS AND OCCUPANTS OF THE PROJECT FROM AND AGAINST
                                         ALL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF TENANT’S
                                         GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILFUL MISCONDUCT IN THE CURE OF OR
                                         ATTEMPT TO CURE ANY CRITICAL SERVICE FAILURE.
