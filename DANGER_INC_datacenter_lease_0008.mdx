             14. WAIVER OF CLAIMS; INDEMNITY.
                   14.1 Waiver. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Tenant, as a material part of the consideration to Landlord, hereby
              waives all claims it may have against the Landlord Group (as defined in the Basic Lease Information) for damage to or loss of
              property (including, without limitation, loss of profits and intangible property) or bodily injury or loss of life or other damages
              of any kind resulting from the Property, the Building, the Datacenter or the Tenant Space or any part thereof becoming out of
              repair, by reason of any repair or alteration thereof, or resulting from any accident within the Property, the Building,



              the Datacenter, the Datacenter Connection Area or the Tenant Space or on or about any space adjoining the same, or resulting
              directly or indirectly from any act or omission of any person, or due to any condition, design or defect of the Property, the
              Building, the Datacenter or the Tenant Space, or any space adjoining the same, or the mechanical systems of the Building or the
              Datacenter, which may exist or occur, whether such damage, loss or injury results from conditions arising upon the Tenant
              Space, the Datacenter Connection Area or upon other portions of the Datacenter or the Building, or from other sources or
              places, and regardless of whether the cause of such damage, loss or injury or the means of repairing the same is accessible to
              Tenant; provided, however, that such assumption and waiver shall not apply to the extent such claims proximately caused by
              the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any member of the Landlord Group. Tenant agrees that, except to the extent
              caused by Landlord’s gross negligence or will misconduct, Landlord will not have any responsibility or liability for any
              damage to Tenant’s equipment or interruption of Tenant’s operations which is caused by any other tenant or occupant of the
              Datacenter, the Building or the Property or the employees, agents, contractors, technicians, representatives, customers, co-
              locators or invitees of any such tenant or occupant.

                    14.2 Indemnification. Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord and the Landlord Group
              (as such term is defined in the Basic Lease Information) from and against (and to reimburse Landlord and the Landlord Group)
              for any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, damages (including, without limitation, any form of Tenant and/or
              third party consequential damages), obligations, liabilities, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
              attorneys’ fees, legal costs, and other costs and expenses of defending against any claims, actions, suits, or proceedings)
              (collectively, “Claims”) arising from, in connection with, or in any manner relating to (or alleged to arise from, to be in
              connection with, or to be in any manner related to): (i) the use or occupancy of the Tenant Space or any portion of the
              Datacenter Connection Area, the Datacenter, the Building or the Property by Tenant or any person claiming by, through or
              under Tenant, its partners, and their respective officers, agents, servants or employees of Tenant or any such person
              (collectively, “Tenant Parties”) (not arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its employees,
              agents, contractors or invitees), (ii) the negligence or willful omissions of Tenant or any Tenant Parties with respect to the
              Tenant Space, the Building or the Property, or (iii) any default of this Lease by Tenant. In the event that any action or
              proceeding is brought against Landlord or any member of the Landlord Group by reason of any such Claim, Tenant upon notice
              from Landlord shall defend such action or proceeding at Tenant’s cost and expense by counsel reasonably approved by
              Landlord. Tenant’s obligations under this Section 14.2 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease as to any matters
              arising prior to such expiration or termination or prior to Tenant’s vacation of the Tenant Space and the Building.
              Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Section 14.2, nothing contained in this Section 14.2 shall be
              interpreted or used in any way to affect, limit, reduce or abrogate any insurance coverage provided by any insurer to either
              Tenant or Landlord. This indemnity provision shall survive the termination or expiration of this Lease.

                    14.3 Consequential Damages. Under no circumstances whatsoever shall Landlord or Tenant be liable under this Lease
              for consequential damages or special damages. The foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree
              that, in no event, shall the elevated Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder in connection with Section 13.3 be deemed
              to represent any form of consequential damages or special damages.

                    14.4 Liens. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Tenant have any right (express or implied)
              to create or permit there to be established any lien or encumbrance of any nature against the Tenant Space, the Building or the
              Property or against Landlord’s or Tenant’s interest therein or hereunder, including, without limitation, for any improvement or
              improvements by Tenant, and Tenant shall fully pay the cost of any improvement or improvements made or contracted for by
              Tenant. Tenant shall require each contractor which it engages to perform any improvements or alterations within the Tenant
              Space or elsewhere in the Building or the Property, to acknowledge and agree in writing that it is performing its work under its
              agreement with Tenant solely for the benefit of Tenant and that Tenant is not acting as Landlord’s agent. Any mechanic’s lien
              filed against the Tenant Space, the Building or the Property, or any portion of any of the above, for work claimed to have been
              done, or materials claimed to



              have been furnished to Tenant, shall be duly discharged or bonded by Tenant within ten (10) days after notice of the filing of
              the lien.

                   14.5 Waiver of Landlord’s Lien. Landlord hereby expressly waives and releases any and all contractual liens and
              security interests or constitutional and/or statutory liens and security interests arising by operation of law to which Landlord
              might now or hereafter be entitled on the property of Tenant which Tenant now or hereafter places in or upon the Premises
              (except for judgment liens that may arise in favor of Landlord). The waiver and release contained herein shall not waive,
              release or otherwise affect any unsecured claim Landlord may have against Tenant.

              15. TENANT DEFAULT.
                  15.1 Events of Default By Tenant. Each of the following acts or omissions of Tenant or occurrences shall constitute an
              “Event of Default”:
                        15.1.1 Any failure or refusal by Tenant to timely pay any Rent or any other payments or charges required to be paid
              hereunder, or any portion thereof, within three (3) days of notice that the same is due.

                         15.1.2 Any failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other covenant or condition of this Lease (including, without
              limitation, in the Datacenter Rules and Regulations) to be performed or observed by Tenant (other than those described in
              Section 15.1.1, above or Sections 15.1.3, 15.1.4, or 15.1.5, below) if such failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days
              following written notice to Tenant of such failure; provided, however, that in the event Tenant’s failure to perform or observe
              any covenant or condition of this Lease to be performed or observed by Tenant cannot reasonably be cured within thirty
              (30) days following written notice to Tenant, Tenant shall not be in default if Tenant commences to cure same within ten
              (10) days after Tenant’s receipt of written notice thereof and thereafter diligently prosecutes the curing thereof to completion.

                          15.1.3 The filing or execution or occurrence of any one of the following: (i) a petition in bankruptcy or other
              insolvency proceeding by or against Tenant, (ii) a petition or answer seeking relief under any provision of the Bankruptcy Act,
              (iii) an assignment for the benefit of creditors, (iv) a petition or other proceeding by or against Tenant for the appointment of a
              trustee, receiver or liquidator of Tenant or any of Tenant’s property, or (v) a proceeding by any governmental authority for the
              dissolution or liquidation of Tenant or any other instance whereby Tenant or any general partner of Tenant shall cease doing
              business as a going concern, where such petition, assignment or proceeding is not dismissed within sixty (60) days after filing.

                        15.1.4 Any failure by Tenant to execute and deliver any statement or document described in either Article 11 or
              Section 12.1 requested to be so executed and delivered by Landlord within the time periods specified therein applicable thereto,
              where such failure continues for three (3) days after delivery of written notice of such failure by Landlord to Tenant.

                        The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all of the notice periods provided in this Section 15.1 are in lieu of,
              and not in addition to, the notice requirements of any Applicable Laws.

                   15.2 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord shall have, in addition to any other
              remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, the option to pursue any one or more of the remedies described in Section 1
              of Exhibit “D” attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, each and all of which shall, subject to applicable law,
              be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice or demand whatsoever (and all of the other provisions of Section 1 of
              Exhibit “D” shall apply to an Event of Default by Tenant hereunder).

              16. LIMITATION OF LANDLORD’S LIABILITY.

  

                    16.1 Landlord Default. In the event that Landlord shall fail to perform any obligation of Landlord to be performed under
              this Lease, Tenant’s sole and exclusive remedies for any such failure shall be an action for money damages, specific
              performance and/or injunctive relief (Tenant hereby waiving the benefit of any laws granting Tenant a lien upon the property of
              Landlord and/or upon rental due Landlord or granting Tenant a right to terminate this Lease upon a default by Landlord);
              provided, however, that Landlord shall not be in default hereunder (and Tenant shall have no right to pursue any such claim for
              damages in connection with any such failure) unless and until Tenant shall have delivered to Landlord a written notice
              specifying such default with particularity, and Landlord shall thereafter have failed to cure such default within thirty (30) days
              (or, if the nature of Landlord’s obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are reasonably required for its performance,
              then not unless Landlord shall have failed to commence such performance of such cure within ten (10) days after its receipt of
              notice thereof from Tenant and thereafter diligently pursue the same to completion). In the event Landlord’s failure to perform
              an obligation of Landlord to be performed under this Lease materially adversely affects Tenant’s use of the Tenant Space for
              the Permitted Use, Landlord shall commence to cure such default within ten (10) business days following receipt of written
              notice from Tenant of such default, and in the event of an emergency, shall commence to cure such default within twenty-four
              (24) hours following receipt of written notice from Tenant of such default, and shall diligently pursue the curing thereof to
              completion. Unless and until Landlord shall have so failed to so cure any such failure after such notice, Tenant shall not have
              any remedy or cause of action by reason thereof. Except as expressly set forth in this Lease, in no event shall Tenant have the
              right to terminate the Lease nor shall Tenant’s obligation to pay Base Rent or other charges under this Lease abate based upon
              any default by Landlord of its obligations under the Lease.

                    16.2 Landlord’s Liability. In consideration of the benefits accruing under this Lease to Tenant and notwithstanding
              anything to the contrary in this Lease or in any exhibits, riders, amendments, or addenda to this Lease (collectively, the “Lease
              Documents”), it is expressly understood and agreed by and between the parties to this Lease that: (i) the recourse of Tenant or
              its successors or assigns against Landlord (and the liability of Landlord to Tenant, its successors and assigns) with respect to
              (a) any actual or alleged breach or breaches by or on the part of Landlord of any representation, warranty, covenant,
              undertaking or agreement contained in any of the Lease Documents, or (b) any matter relating to Tenant’s occupancy of the
              Tenant Space (collectively, the “Landlord’s Lease Undertakings”), shall be limited solely to an aggregate amount equal to
              $5,000,000.00; (ii) Tenant shall have no recourse against any other assets of the Landlord Group (as defined in the Basic Lease
              Information); (iii) except to the extent of Landlord’s interest in the Property, no personal liability or personal responsibility of
              any sort with respect to any of Landlord’s Lease Undertakings or any alleged breach thereof is assumed by, or shall at any time
              be asserted or enforceable against, the Landlord Group, and (iv) at no time shall Landlord be responsible or liable to Tenant for
              any lost profits, lost economic opportunities or any form of consequential damages as the result of any actual or alleged breach
              of Landlord of Landlord’s Lease Undertakings.

                    16.3 Transfer of Landlord’s Interest. Landlord shall have the right, from time to time, to assign its interest in this Lease
              in whole or, to a wholly owned subsidiary, in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any assignment in part to
              a wholly-owned subsidiary, (i) Landlord shall provide a written notice to Tenant specifying the rights and obligations so
              assigned and (ii) Landlord shall guaranty the performance of the obligations assigned to such wholly-owned subsidiary;
              provided, however, Landlord’s maximum liability under such guaranty shall not exceed the maximum liability it would have
              had under this Lease if such obligations had not been assigned. Landlord and each successor to Landlord shall be fully released
              from the performance of Landlord’s obligations under the Lease Documents upon their transfer of Landlord’s interest in the
              Property to a third party. Landlord shall not be liable for any obligation under the Lease Documents after a transfer of its
              interest in the Property and Tenant agrees to look solely to the successor in interest of Landlord in and to this Lease for all
              obligations and liabilities accruing on or after the date of such transfer. If any security has been given by Tenant to secure the
              faithful performance of any of the covenants of this Lease, Landlord may transfer or deliver said security, as such, to
              Landlord’s successor in interest and thereupon Landlord shall be discharged from any further liability with regard to said
              security.
