                               25.15     Signs. All signs and graphics of every kind visible in or from public view or
                                         corridors, the Common Areas or the exterior of the Premises (whether located

                                         provisions of Section 13 (Alterations). Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense,
                                         shall remove all such signs and graphics prior to the termination of this Lease.
                                         Such installations and removals shall be made in such manner as to avoid injury
                                         or defacement of the Premises; and Tenant shall repair any injury or defacement,
                                         including without limitation, discoloration caused by such installation or
                                         removal. Unless otherwise expressly agreed herein, Landlord reserves all rights

                                         signs on the Building, including the roof, which do not unreasonably interfere
                                         with the conduct of Tenant’s business. Landlord shall be entitled to all revenues
                                         from such advertising signs.

                                         omission to take action on account thereof, notwithstanding any custom and
                                         practice or course of dealing. No waiver by either party of any provision under
                                         this Lease shall be effective unless in writing and signed by such party. No

                                         then such waiver shall be operative only for the time and to the extent therein
                                         stated. Waivers of any covenant shall not be construed as a waiver of any
                                         subsequent breach of the same.

                                         Guarantor, if applicable) at any time, and shall execute such further
                                         authorizations as Landlord may reasonably require in order to obtain a credit

                                         Broker as its broker, agent or finder in connection with this Lease. Tenant shall

                                         Tenant in connection with this Lease. Landlord shall indemnify, defend and hold

                                         this Lease. Tenant acknowledges that any affiliate of Landlord that is involved in
                                         the negotiation of this Lease is representing only Landlord, and that any
                                         assistance rendered by any agent or employee of such affiliate in connection
                                         with this Lease or any subsequent amendment or other document related hereto
                                         has been or will be rendered as an accommodation to Tenant solely in
                                         furtherance of consummating the transaction on behalf of Landlord, and not as
                                         agent for Tenant.
                               25.19     Authorization. If Tenant signs as a corporation, partnership, limited liability

                                         do business in the state in which the Premises is located, that the entity has full
                                         right and authority to enter into this Lease, and that all persons signing on behalf
                                         of the entity were authorized to do so by appropriate actions. Tenant agrees to
                                         deliver to Landlord, simultaneously with the delivery of this Lease, a corporate
                                         resolution, proof of due authorization by partners, opinion of counsel or other
                                         appropriate documentation reasonably acceptable to Landlord evidencing the
                                         due authorization of Tenant to enter into this Lease.

                                         Tenant, their execution of this Lease will constitute their covenant and

                                         observing and performing of all of the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions
                                         and agreements of this Lease to be kept, observed and performed by Tenant; and
                                         (ii) the term "Tenant" as used in this Lease means and includes each of them
                                         jointly and severally. The act of or notice from, or the signature of any one or
                                         more of them, with respect to the tenancy of this Lease, including, but not
                                         limited to the exercise of any options hereunder, will be binding upon each and
                                         all of the persons executing this Lease as Tenant with the same force and effect
                                         as if each and all of them had so acted.
