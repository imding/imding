**Article 12** - **Repair and maintenance of the Premises**

12.1.The Tenant shall occupy the Leased Premises with due and proper care. The Tenant undertakes to keep the Leased Premises at its own cost in a constant good state of maintenance and repair during the entire term of the present Agreement, and it shall be responsible for all maintenance and repair of the Leased Premises, to the exception of the maintenance and repair obligations for the Landlord, as further set out in Article 12.2. below.

12.2.The Landlord is responsible for structural works and major repairs as referred to in the articles 605 and 606 of the Belgian Civil Code. Are to be considered such "major repairs" ("*grosses reparations/grove herstellingen")* and are to be carried out by the Landlord at the latter's own expense, a.o. works of maintenance and repair relative to the structure, the stability, the foundations, the floor, the roof and the external walls of the Leased Premises. The Landlord will carry out these works and repairs within a reasonable period and will use commercially best efforts to minimize interference with Tenant's business operations. If the repairs take longer than thirty (30) days (from receipt by the Landlord of a notification by the Tenant informing him of the structural defects or necessary major repairs) to complete due to a failure by the Landlord to comply with its

obligations hereunder, the Rental Fee will be reduced in proportion with the significance and magnitude of the inconvenience caused by the necessary structural works or major repairs as from the end of the calendar month in which such remedial period expires, until the date the relevant works are substantially completed and the Leased Premises are again fully tenantable by the Tenant. In case of the works and repairs under this Article are not substantially completed due to a failure by the Landlord to comply with its obligations hereunder within sixty (60) or more days from receipt by the Landlord of the above referenced notification by the Tenant and the Premises are completely untenantable, Tenant shall also have the option, at Tenant's discretion, to terminate the Agreement without consideration for early termination being due to the Landlord but without prejudice to the further provisions of this Agreement.

12.3.The Landlord may require the Tenant to carry out all necessary repair and maintenance works for which it is responsible pursuant to article 12.1 above, and to complete such works within four (4) weeks as from receipt by the Tenant of a notification by the Landlord in this respect. Should the Tenant fail to meet these obligations, the Landlord is authorized to have the works carried out in order to maintain and restore the Leased Premises in good condition at the expense and risk of the defaulting Tenant. In such event the Tenant will reimburse all costs of those works, provided the Landlord provides the Tenant with the necessary documents (invoices) proving those costs.

12.4.The Tenant will tolerate the execution of all structural works, repairs or improvements which might become necessary during the term of present Agreement and this regardless the duration of said structural works, repairs or improvements. The Landlord shall however always ensure, when planning such works, that the impact of such works on the Tenant's operational activities is reduced to an absolute minimum; the Landlord shall comply with any reasonable recommendations the Tenant may issue to the Landlord in this respect.

12.5.The Tenant will inform the Landlord as soon as reasonably possible following discovery of circumstances requiring the carrying out of any structural works or major repairs incumbent upon the Landlord.

12.6.The Tenant must ensure the safety of the Leased Premises. The Tenant expressly relieves the Landlord from any liability in the event of damages caused by theft, riot and any other action beyond the Landlord's reasonable control or by third-parties, that arise in front of or in the Leased Premises or in the immediate vicinity, as well as from any responsibility in connection with the foregoing, except if caused by the Landlord, its employees and representatives.
