25. LANDLORD’S REMEDIES
                   (a) Termination. In the event of any Default by Tenant, then in addition to any other remedies available to
              Landlord at law or in equity and under this Lease, Landlord shall have the immediate option to terminate this Lease
              and all rights of Tenant hereunder by giving written notice to Tenant of such intention to terminate. If Landlord shall
              elect to so terminate this Lease then Landlord may recover from Tenant:

                       (1) the worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent and any other sums due and payable which have
              been earned at the time of such termination; plus

                       (2) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent and any other sums due and
              payable which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental
              loss Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus

                       (3) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent and any other sums due and
              payable for the balance of the term of this Lease after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
              Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; plus

                        (4) any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by
              Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course would be likely to result
              therefrom, including, without limitation, (A) any costs or expenses incurred by Landlord (1) in retaking possession
              of the Premises; (2) in maintaining, repairing, preserving, restoring, replacing, cleaning, altering, remodeling or
              rehabilitating the Premises or any affected portions of the Building or the Project, including such actions undertaken
              in connection with the reletting or attempted reletting of the Premises to a new tenant or tenants; (3) for leasing
              commissions, advertising costs and other expenses of reletting the Premises; or (4) in carrying the Premises,
              including taxes, insurance premiums, utilities and security precautions; (B) any unearned brokerage commissions
              paid in connection with this Lease; (C) reimbursement of any previously waived or abated Base Rent or Additional
              Rent or any free rent or reduced rental rate granted hereunder; and (D) any concession made or paid by Landlord for
              the benefit of Tenant including, but not limited to, any moving allowances, contributions, payments or loans by
              Landlord for tenant improvements or build-out allowances (including without limitation, any unamortized portion of
              the Tenant Improvement Allowance, such Tenant Improvement Allowance to be amortized over the Term in the
              manner reasonably determined by Landlord), if any, and any outstanding balance (principal and accrued interest) of
              the Tenant Improvement Loan, if any), or assumptions by Landlord of any of Tenant’s previous lease obligations;
              plus

                        (5) such reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by Landlord as a result of a Default, and costs in the event suit
              is filed by Landlord to enforce such remedy; and plus

                      (6) at Landlord’s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted
              from time to time by applicable law.



                   As used in subparagraphs (1) and (2) above, the “worth at the time of award” is computed by allowing interest
              at an annual rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. As
              used in subparagraph (3) above, the “worth at the time of award” is computed by discounting such amount at the
              discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award, plus one percent (1%). Tenant
              hereby waives for Tenant and all those claiming under Tenant all right now or hereafter existing to redeem by order
              or judgment of any court or by any legal process or writ, Tenant’s right of occupancy of the Premises after any
              termination of this Lease. Tenant waives redemption or relief from forfeiture under California Code of Civil
              Procedure Sections 1174 and 1179, or under any other pertinent present or future Law, in the event Tenant is evicted
              or Landlord takes possession of the Premises by reason of any Default of Tenant hereunder.

                   (b) Continuation of Lease. In the event of any Default by Tenant, then in addition to any other remedies
              available to Landlord at law or in equity and under this Lease, Landlord shall have the remedy described in
              California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (Landlord may continue this Lease in effect after Tenant’s Default and
              abandonment and recover Rent as it becomes due, provided Tenant has the right to sublet or assign, subject only to
              reasonable limitations). In addition, Landlord shall not be liable in any way whatsoever for its failure or refusal to
              relet the Premises. For purposes of this Paragraph 25(b), the following acts by Landlord will not constitute the
              termination of Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises:

                        (1) Acts of maintenance or preservation or efforts to relet the Premises, including, but not limited to,
              alterations, remodeling, redecorating, repairs, replacements and/or painting as Landlord shall consider advisable for
              the purpose of reletting the Premises or any part thereof, or

                       (2) The appointment of a receiver upon the initiative of Landlord to protect Landlord’s interest under this
              Lease or in the Premises.

                   (c) Re-entry. In the event of any Default by Tenant, Landlord shall also have the right, with or without
              terminating this Lease, in compliance with applicable law, to re-enter the Premises, by force if necessary, and
              remove all persons and property from the Premises; such property may be removed and stored in a public warehouse
              or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of Tenant.

                    (d) Reletting. In the event of the abandonment of the Premises by Tenant or in the event that Landlord shall
              elect to re-enter as provided in Paragraph 25(b) or shall take possession of the Premises pursuant to legal proceeding
              or pursuant to any notice provided by law, then if Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as provided in
              Paragraph 25(a), Landlord may from time to time, without terminating this Lease, relet the Premises or any part
              thereof for such term or terms and at such rental or rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord in
              its sole discretion may deem advisable with the right to make alterations and repairs to the Premises in Landlord’s
              sole discretion. In the event that Landlord shall elect to so relet, then rentals received by Landlord from such
              reletting shall be applied in the following order: (1) to reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by Landlord as a result of
              a Default and costs in the event suit is filed by Landlord to enforce such remedies; (2) to the payment of any
              indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord; (3) to the payment of any costs of such
              reletting;




              (4) to the payment of the costs of any alterations and repairs to the Premises; (5) to the payment of Rent due and
              unpaid hereunder; and (6) the residue, if any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Rent and
              other sums payable by Tenant hereunder as the same may become due and payable hereunder. Should that portion of
              such rentals received from such reletting during any month, which is applied to the payment of Rent hereunder, be
              less than the Rent payable during the month by Tenant hereunder, then Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord.
              Such deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord, as soon as ascertained, any
              costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in such reletting or in making such alterations and repairs not covered by
              the rentals received from such reletting.

                   (e) Termination. No re-entry or taking of possession of the Premises by Landlord pursuant to this Paragraph 25
              shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such intention is given to Tenant
              or unless the termination thereof is decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any reletting
              without termination by Landlord because of any Default by Tenant, Landlord may at any time after such reletting
              elect to terminate this Lease for any such Default.

                  (f) Cumulative Remedies. The remedies herein provided are not exclusive and Landlord shall have any and all
              other remedies provided herein or by law or in equity.

                    (g) No Surrender. No act or conduct of Landlord, whether consisting of the acceptance of the keys to the
              Premises, or otherwise, shall be deemed to be or constitute an acceptance of the surrender of the Premises by Tenant
              prior to the expiration of the Term, and such acceptance by Landlord of surrender by Tenant shall only flow from
              and must be evidenced by a written acknowledgment of acceptance of surrender signed by Landlord. The surrender
              of this Lease by Tenant, voluntarily or otherwise, shall not work a merger unless Landlord elects in writing that such
              merger take place, but shall operate as an assignment to Landlord of any and all existing subleases, or Landlord may,
              at its option, elect in writing to treat such surrender as a merger terminating Tenant’s estate under this Lease, and
              thereupon Landlord may terminate any or all such subleases by notifying the sublessee of its election so to do within
              five (5) days after such surrender.

                   (h) Intentionally Deleted.
