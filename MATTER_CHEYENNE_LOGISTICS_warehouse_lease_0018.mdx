                               25.30     Auctions. Tenant shall not conduct, nor permit to be conducted, either
                                         voluntarily or involuntarily, any auction upon the Premises or the Common
                                         Areas without first having obtained Landlord's prior written consent, which
                                         Landlord may withhold in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the
                                         contrary in this Lease, Landlord shall not be obligated to exercise any standard
                                         of reasonableness in determining whether to grant such consent.
                               25.31     Unrelated Business Income. If Landlord is advised by its counsel at any time
                                         that any part of the payments by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease may be
                                         characterized as unrelated business income under the United States Internal
                                         Revenue Code and its regulations, then Tenant shall enter into any amendment
                                         proposed by Landlord to avoid such income, so long as the amendment does not
                                         require Tenant to make more payments or accept fewer services from Landlord,
                                         than this Lease provides.

                               25.32     Independent Covenants. This Lease shall be construed as though the covenants
                                         herein between Landlord and Tenant are independent and not dependent and
                                         Tenant hereby expressly waives the benefit of any statute to the contrary and
                                         agrees that if Landlord fails to perform its obligations set forth herein, Tenant
                                         shall not be entitled to make any repairs or perform any acts hereunder at
                                         Landlord’s expense or to any setoff of the Rent or other amounts owing
                                         hereunder against Landlord.

                                         Tenant acknowledges that the content of this Lease and any related documents
                                         are confidential information. Tenant shall keep such confidential information
                                         strictly confidential and shall not disclose such confidential information to any
                                         person or entity other than Tenant’s financial, legal and space planning
                                         consultants.

                                         pays directly to the provider for any energy consumed at the Project, Tenant,
                                         promptly upon request, shall deliver to Landlord (or, at Landlord’s option,
                                         execute and deliver to Landlord an instrument enabling Landlord to obtain from
                                         such provider) any data about such consumption at the Building that Landlord
                                         may request.
                               25.35     Zoning. The Premises is currently zoned M-1 in the City of North Las Vegas.

                                         required to operate Tenant’s business from the Premises. Landlord makes no
                                         representation concerning the suitability of the Premises for Tenant’s intended
                                         use. It is Tenant’s sole responsibility to determine whether or not Lessee’s

                                         zoning and fire code and for securing all necessary permits and licenses
                                         associated with Tenant’s use.
