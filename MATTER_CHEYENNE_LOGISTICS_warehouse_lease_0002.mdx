                                         acceptable for Tenant's use. Tenant hereby acknowledges that the area of the
                                         Premises, the Building and the Project set forth in the Basic Lease Information is

                               2.2       Use. The Premises shall be used only for the Permitted Use and for no other uses
                                         without Landlord's written consent. Tenant's use of the Premises shall be in
                                         compliance with and subject to all applicable laws, statutes, codes, ordinances,
                                         orders, zoning, rules, regulations, conditions of approval and requirements of all
                                         federal, state, county, municipal and governmental authorities and all
                                         administrative or judicial orders or decrees and all permits, licenses, approvals

                                         without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 USC 12111
                                         et seq. (the "ADA") as the same may be amended from time to time, all
                                         Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 15.1), and any covenants, conditions
                                         and restrictions encumbering the Land and/or the Project ("CC&Rs") or any
                                         supplement thereto recorded in any official or public records with respect to the
                                         Project or any portion thereof (collectively, "Applicable Laws"). Tenant shall be
                                         responsible for obtaining any permit, business license, or other permits or
                                         licenses required by any governmental agency permitting Tenant's use or
                                         occupancy of the Premises and, except as set forth in the Work Letter, for
                                         performing, at Tenant’s sole cost, all modifications or additions to the Premises



                                                                 Document




                                         in order to be in ADA compliance for its use of the Premises. Landlord warrants
                                         that the Tenant Improvements constructed by Landlord pursuant to the Work
                                         Letter will comply with ADA upon the Commencement Date. Except as
                                         specifically set forth in the preceding sentence, Landlord shall have no
                                         obligation to bring the Premises into compliance with ADA. If a change to the
                                         Premises becomes required under Applicable Laws (or if any such requirement
                                         is enforced) as a result of any Alterations (herein defined) made to the Premises
                                         by Tenant, the installation of any trade fixture in the Premises by Tenant, any
                                         particular use of the Premises by Tenant other than the Permitted Use, or any
                                         breach of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, then Tenant, upon demand, shall
                                         (x) at Landlord’s option, either make such change at Tenant’s cost or pay
                                         Landlord the cost of making such change. In no event shall the Premises be used
                                         for any Prohibited Use (as defined in Exhibit C). Tenant and all Tenant’s Parties
                                         shall comply with the rules and regulations attached hereto as Exhibit D,
                                         together with such additional rules and regulations as Landlord may from time to
                                         time prescribe ("Rules and Regulations"). Landlord shall not knowingly
                                         discriminate against Tenant in Landlord’s enforcement of the Rules and
                                         Regulations. Landlord shall not be responsible or liable to Tenant for the non-
                                         performance of any other tenant or occupant of the Building or Project of the
                                         Rules and Regulations or for any

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                                3







                                         interference or disturbance of Tenant by any other tenant or occupant. Tenant
                                         shall not commit waste, overload the floors or structure of the Building, subject
                                         the Premises, the Building, the Common Area, or the Project to any use which
                                         would damage the same or increase the risk of loss or violate any insurance
                                         coverage, permit any unreasonable odors, smoke, dust, gas, substances, noise or
                                         vibrations to emanate from the Premises or the Project, take any action which
                                         would constitute a nuisance or would disturb, obstruct or endanger any other
                                         tenants, take any action which would abrogate any warranties, use or allow the
                                         Project and/or the Premises to be used for any unlawful purpose or conduct, or
                                         permit to be conducted, any auction upon the Project and/or the Premises.
