                     13.       ALTERATIONS.

                               13.1      Trade Fixtures; Alterations. Subject to limitations set forth in this Lease,
                                         Tenant may install necessary trade fixtures, equipment and furniture in the
                                         Premises, provided that all alterations are done in compliance with Exhibit F
                                         and such items are installed and are removable without structural or material
                                         damage to the Premises, or the Building. Except for non-structural alterations or
                                         additions costing less than Fifteen Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($15,000.00)
                                         which are not visible from the outside of the Premises through the windows of
                                         the Building, Tenant shall not construct, nor allow to be constructed, any
                                         alterations or physical additions in, about or to the Premises without obtaining
                                         the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall be conditioned upon
                                         Tenant's compliance with the provisions of Exhibit F and any other applicable
                                         requirements of Landlord regarding construction of improvements and
                                         alterations. If Landlord does not respond to a written request from Tenant made
                                         in accordance with Exhibit F within ten (10) business days, then Landlord shall
                                         be deemed to approve such request. If requested by Landlord, Tenant shall file a





                                         notice of completion after completion of such work and provide Landlord with a
                                         copy thereof.
                               13.2      Damage; Removal. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease,
                                         subject to normal wear and tear, Tenant shall remove any or all trade fixtures,
                                         alterations, additions, improvements and partitions made or installed by or for
                                         the benefit of Tenant ("Alteration(s)") and repair all damage caused by the
                                         installation or removal thereof; provided, however, Landlord may require Tenant
                                         to have all or any portion of such items designated by Landlord at the time of
                                         providing its consent to the Alteration to remain at the Premises, in which event
                                         they shall be and become the property of Landlord upon the expiration or earlier
                                         termination of this Lease. All such removals and restoration shall be
                                         accomplished in a good and workmanlike manner and so as not to cause any
                                         damage to the Premises, the Building, the Common Area, or the Project
                                         whatsoever.
                               13.3      Liens. Tenant shall promptly pay and discharge all claims for labor performed,
                                         supplies furnished and services rendered at the request of Tenant and shall keep
                                         the Premises, the

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                            15





                                         Building, and the Project, free of all mechanics' and materialmen's liens in
                                         connection therewith. Tenant shall remove any such lien within ten (10) business
                                         days after notice from Landlord, and if Tenant fails to do so, an Event of Default
                                         by Tenant shall have occurred, and in addition, Landlord, without limiting its
                                         remedies, may bond, insure over or otherwise pay the amount necessary to cause
                                         such removal, whether or not such lien is valid. The amount so paid, together
                                         with reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, shall be reimbursed by Tenant
                                         upon demand. Tenant shall provide at least ten (10) days prior written notice to
                                         Landlord before any labor is performed, supplies furnished or services rendered
                                         on or at the Premises and Landlord shall have the right to post on the Premises
                                         notices of non-responsibility. Tenant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
                                         Landlord and its agents and representatives from and against all claims,
                                         demands, causes of action, suits, judgments, damages and expenses (including
                                         attorneys’ fees) in any way arising from or relating to the failure by Tenant to
                                         pay for any work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by or at
                                         the request of any of Tenant’s respective agents, contractors, employees,
                                         licensees, guests and invitees. This indemnity provision shall survive termination
                                         or expiration of this Lease. Pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes (“NRS”)
                                         §108.234(3)(e), Landlord hereby informs Tenant that if Tenant undertakes the
                                         work, Tenant must comply with the requirements of NRS §108.2403. Tenant
                                         shall take all actions necessary under Nevada law to ensure that no liens
                                         encumbering Landlord’s interest in the Premises arise as a result of the
                                         construction of the work, which actions shall include, without limitation, the
                                         recording of a notice of posted security in the Official Records of Clark County,
                                         Nevada, in accordance with NRS §108.2403, and either (i) establish a
                                         construction disbursement account pursuant to NRS §108.2403(1)(b)(1), or (ii)
                                         furnish and record, in accordance with NRS §108.2403(1)(b)(2), a surety bond
                                         for the prime contract for the construction of tenant improvements that meets the
                                         requirements of NRS §108.2415. Tenant may not begin construction of any
                                         tenant improvements in the Premises until Tenant has delivered evidence
                                         satisfactory to Landlord that Tenant has complied with the terms of this Section
                                         13.3. Failure by Tenant to comply with the terms of this Section 13.3 shall
                                         permit Landlord to declare an event of default hereunder.

                     14.       LANDLORD'S RIGHTS. Landlord reserves the right to enter the Premises upon
                               reasonable advance notice to Tenant of no less than two (2) business days (or without
                               notice in case of an emergency) and provided that Landlord shall use best efforts not nor
                               materially or adversely impact Tenant’s business and operation to undertake the
                               following all without abatement of rent or liability to Tenant, except as provided in this
                               Lease: inspect the Premises and/or the performance by Tenant of the terms and
                               conditions hereof; make such alterations, repairs, improvements or additions to the
                               Premises as required or permitted hereunder; change boundary lines of the Land so long
                               as such change does not materially and adversely impact Tenant's use of the parking area
                               and/or access to the Premises; install, use, maintain, repair, alter, relocate or replace any
                               pipes, ducts, conduits, wires, equipment and other facilities in the Common Area or the
                                                               Document




                               Building; install, maintain and operate conduit cabling within the utility and/or conduit
                               ducts and risers within the Building, as well as grant lease, license or use rights to third
                               parties, to utilize the foregoing easements or licenses on the Land, the Property and/or
                               the Project; grant easements, rights of way, utility raceways and make dedications;
                               dedicate for public use portions of the Land, the Property and/or the Project not
                               materially and adversely impact Tenant's access to the Premises; and record parcel maps,
                               restrictions, covenants, conditions and restrictions affecting the Land, the Property
                               and/or the Project and/or amendments to existing CC&Rs which do not unreasonably
                               interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises or impose additional material monetary
                               obligations on Tenant; change the name of the Building, the Property and/or the Project;
                               affix reasonable signs and displays on the Building and/or the Land (including rental
                               signs); and, show the Premises to prospective purchasers, current or prospective
                               investors, Mortgagees, ground lessees or insurers, or, during the last twelve (12) months
                               of the Term (or following any Event of Default), prospective tenants. If reasonably
                               necessary, Landlord may temporarily close all or a portion of the Premises to perform
                               repairs, alterations and additions; provided, however, except in emergencies, Landlord
                               will not close the Premises if the work can reasonably be completed on weekends and
                               after

              EXECUTION COPY

                                                                            16





                               normal business hours. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any repair or
                               alteration to the Premises by Landlord allowed in this Section 14, Landlord will, other
                               than in an emergency, provide Tenant with thirty (30) days’ notice of such repair,
                               maintenance or alteration to allow Tenant to mitigate and reduce any operational impact
                               on its business. Entry by Landlord shall not constitute a constructive eviction or entitle
                               Tenant to an abatement or reduction of Rent, except as provided in this Lease.
