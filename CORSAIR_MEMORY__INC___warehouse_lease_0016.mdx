26. LANDLORD’S RIGHT TO PERFORM TENANT’S OBLIGATIONS
                   (a) Without limiting the rights and remedies of Landlord contained in Paragraph 25 above, if Tenant shall be in
              Default in the performance of any of the terms, provisions, covenants or conditions to be performed or complied
              with by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, then Landlord may at Landlord’s option, without any obligation to do so, and
              without notice to Tenant perform any such term, provision, covenant, or condition, or make any such payment and
              Landlord by reason of so doing shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage thereby sustained by Tenant
              or anyone holding under or through Tenant or any of Tenant’s Agents.

                  (b) Without limiting the rights of Landlord under Paragraph 26(a) above, Landlord shall have the right at
              Landlord’s option, without any obligation to do so, to perform any of Tenant’s covenants or obligations under this
              Lease without notice to Tenant in the case of an

 
              emergency, as determined by Landlord in its sole and absolute judgment, or if Landlord otherwise determines in its
              sole discretion that such performance is necessary or desirable for the proper management and operation of the
              Building or the Project or for the preservation of the rights and interests or safety of other tenants of the Building or
              the Project.

                   (c) If Landlord performs any of Tenant’s obligations hereunder in accordance with this Paragraph 26, the full
              amount of the cost and expense incurred or the payment so made or the amount of the loss so sustained shall
              immediately be owing by Tenant to Landlord, and Tenant shall promptly pay to Landlord upon demand, as
              Additional Rent, the full amount thereof with interest thereon from the date of payment by Landlord at the lower of
              (1) ten percent (10%) per annum, or (2) the highest rate permitted by applicable law.

              27. ATTORNEY’S FEES
                   (a) If either party hereto fails to perform any of its obligations under this Lease or if any dispute arises between
              the parties hereto concerning the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Lease, then the defaulting party
              or the party not prevailing in such dispute, as the case may be, shall pay any and all costs and expenses incurred by
              the other party on account of such default and/or in enforcing or establishing its rights hereunder, including, without
              limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements. Any such attorneys’ fees and other expenses
              incurred by either party in enforcing a judgment in its favor under this Lease shall be recoverable separately from
              and in addition to any other amount included in such judgment, and such attorneys’ fees obligation is intended to be
              severable from the other provisions of this Lease and to survive and not be merged into any such judgment.

                   (b) Without limiting the generality of Paragraph 27(a) above, if Landlord utilizes the services of an attorney for
              the purpose of collecting any Rent due and unpaid by Tenant or in connection with any other breach of this Lease by
              Tenant, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord actual attorneys’ fees as determined by Landlord for such services, regardless
              of the fact that no legal action may be commenced or filed by Landlord.
