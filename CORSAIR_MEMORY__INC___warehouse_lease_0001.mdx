                   THIS LEASE AGREEMENT is made and entered into by and between Landlord and Tenant on the Lease Date.
              The defined terms used in this Lease which are defined in the Basic Lease Information attached to this Lease
              Agreement (“Basic Lease Information”) shall have the meaning and definition given them in the Basic Lease
              Information. The Basic Lease Information, the exhibits, the addendum or addenda described in the Basic Lease
              Information, and this Lease Agreement are and shall be construed as a single instrument and are referred to herein as
              the “Lease.”

              1.   DEMISE
                  In consideration for the rents and all other charges and payments payable by Tenant, and for the agreements,
              terms and conditions to be performed by Tenant in this Lease, LANDLORD DOES HEREBY LEASE TO
              TENANT, AND TENANT DOES HEREBY HIRE AND TAKE FROM LANDLORD, the Premises described
              below (the “Premises”), upon the agreements, terms and conditions of this Lease for the Term hereinafter stated.

              2.   PREMISES
                   The Premises demised by this Lease consist of that certain building (the “Building”) specified in the Basic
              Lease Information, which Building is located in that certain real estate development (the “Project”) specified in the
              Basic Lease Information, together with the parcel of land on which the Building is situated. The Building has the
              address and contains the square footage specified in the Basic Lease Information; provided, however, that any
              statement of square footage set forth in this Lease, or that may have been used in calculating any of the economic
              terms hereof, is an approximation which Landlord and Tenant agree is reasonable and, no economic terms based
              thereon shall be subject to revision whether or not the actual square footage is more or less. The location of the
              Building is depicted on Exhibit A, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. The Premises
              include the parking area (“Parking Area”) adjacent to the Building as shown on Exhibit A. Tenant shall have the
              non-exclusive right to use the Common Areas (as hereinafter defined). For purposes of this Lease, the term
              “Common Areas” shall mean all areas and facilities, if any, outside the Premises and within the exterior boundary
              line of the Project that are, from time to time, provided and designated by Landlord for the non-exclusive use of
              Landlord, Tenant and other tenants of the Project and their respective employees, guests and invitees.

                   The Premises shall be leased by Tenant in “as-is” condition without any improvements or alterations by
              Landlord, except to the extent Landlord has expressly agreed to make such improvements or alterations in the
              Tenant Improvement Work Letter attached hereto as Exhibit B. Landlord and Tenant agree to and shall be bound by
              the terms and conditions of Exhibit B.

                   Provided Landlord does not materially, adversely affect Tenant’s use of the Premises, the Building or the
              Parking Area, or unreasonably interfere with Tenant’s use and quiet enjoyment of the Premises, Landlord has the
              right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to: (a) make reasonable changes to the Building, the Premises and/or
              the Project, including, without

                                                                        

              limitation, changes in the exact configuration and/or location of ingress and egress; (b) close temporarily facilities or
              areas for maintenance purposes so long as reasonable access to the Building and Parking Area remains available;
              (c) use the Parking Area while engaged in making additional improvements, repairs or alterations to the Project or
              any portion thereof; and (d) do and perform any other acts that alter or expand or make any other changes in, to or
              with respect to the Building, the Premises and/or the Project as Landlord may, in its sole discretion, deem to be
              appropriate.

                   Without limiting the foregoing, Landlord reserves the right from time to time to install, use, maintain, repair,
              relocate and replace pipes, ducts, conduits, wires, and appurtenant meters and equipment for service to the Premises
              which are above the ceiling surfaces, below the floor surfaces, within the walls and in the central core areas of the
              Building. In connection with any of the foregoing activities of Landlord, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts while
              conducting such activities to minimize any interference with Tenant’s use of the Premises.

                   No rights to any view or to light or air over any property, whether belonging to Landlord or any other person,
              are granted to Tenant by this Lease. If at any time any windows of the Building are reasonably temporarily darkened
              or the light or view therefrom is obstructed by reason of any repairs, improvements, maintenance or cleaning in or
              about the Building, the same shall be without liability to Landlord and without any reduction or diminution of
              Tenant’s obligations under this Lease.
