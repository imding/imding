                   3.1 Base Rent. Commencing on the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord base rent (the “Base
              Rent”) for the Tenant Space in the amount set forth in Item 9 of the Basic Lease Information. All such Base Rent
              shall be paid to Landlord in monthly installments in advance on the first day of each and every month throughout the
              Term of this Lease; provided, however, that (a) the first full monthly installment of Base Rent shall be payable upon
              Tenant’s execution of this Lease and (b) if the Term of this Lease does not commence on the first day of a calendar
              month, the Base Rent for such partial calendar month shall (i) be calculated on a per diem basis determined by
              dividing the Base Rent above by the number thirty (30) and multiplying such amount by the number of days
              remaining in such calendar month from and after (and including) the Commencement Date, and (ii) shall be paid by
              Tenant to Landlord on the Commencement Date. Tenant shall not pay any installment of Rent (defined in Section
              3.4, below) more than one (1) month in advance.

                   taxes, insurance and benefits (including pension, retirement and fringe benefits) relating thereto;

                                                                            -3-

                                                                                                                                      Page

                            (ii) Cost of all supplies and materials used in the operation, maintenance and security of the Property
                   (excluding cleaning and char supplies related to the cleaning of other tenants’ premises);

                   basis, but (A) only if it can be conclusively demonstrated that such item reduced the Operating Expense(s) to
                   which it specifically relates, (B) only to the extent of such demonstrable savings and (C) excluding the cost of
                   any capital improvement arising merely from the breakage or wearing out of a capital item;
                            (viii) Management fee equal to three percent (3%) times the product of gross rents actually collected at
                   the Building during the year at issue (but in no event to exceed the product of the Management Fee Rate Cap
                   (defined below) and the weighted average number of rentable square feet of occupied space in the Building); it
                   being agreed that the management fee shall not be subject to the gross up provision of Section 3.3.4. For the

                   Lease, to twenty-four dollars ($24). For each subsequent year of the Lease, the Management Fee Rate Cap shall
                   escalate at a rate of three percent (3%) per year on a cumulative basis (e.g., in the 2nd and 3rd years of the Lease,
                   the Management Fee Rate Cap shall be $24.72 and $25.46, respectively).

                   To the extent that any Operating Expenses are attributable to the Property and other properties of Landlord
              (specifically, including, without limitation, engineers who rotate among buildings), Landlord shall disclose the same
              to Tenant and a fair and reasonable allocation of such Operating Expenses shall be made between the Property and
              such other properties.

                        (2) The term “Operating Expenses” shall exclude the costs set forth on Exhibit “H”.

                        (4) The term “Actual Operating Expenses” shall mean, with respect to each calendar year during the
              Term, the actual Operating Expenses for such year. The term “Actual Operating Expenses Rate” shall mean, with
              respect to each calendar year during the Term, the Actual Operating Expenses attributable to each square foot of
              rentable area in the Building (as set forth in

                                                                            -4-

              Item 21 of the Basic Lease Information), and shall be calculated by dividing the Actual Operating Expenses by the
              total number of square feet of rentable area in the Building. The term “Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual
              Operating Expenses” shall mean, with respect to each calendar year during the Term, an amount equal to the
              product of (i) the Actual Operating Expenses Rate, multiplied by (ii) the sum of the number of square feet of
              rentable area in the Premises (as defined in Item 7(a) of the Basic Lease Information) in such year.

                        (5) The term “Taxes” shall mean all taxes, assessments and governmental charges (foreseen or unforeseen,
              general or special, ordinary or extraordinary) whether federal, state, county or municipal and whether levied by
              taxing districts or authorities presently taxing the Property or by others subsequently created or otherwise, and any
              other taxes and assessments attributable to the Property or its operation, and all taxes of whatsoever nature that are
              imposed in substitution for or in lieu of any of the taxes, assessments or other charges herein defined (including, but
              not limited to, margin taxes and/or other similar taxes assessed against or imposed on the Property or on Landlord as
              the owner of the Property, or measured by the income or profits of Landlord from the ownership and/or operation of
              the Property, and those taxes described in Section 4.2 hereof). Except as set forth in Article 4 hereof, Taxes shall not
              include any and all federal, state or local (i) franchise, capital stock or similar taxes, if any, of Landlord (unless in
              lieu of or a substitute for any other tax or assessment upon or with respect to any of the Tenant Space which, if such
              other tax or assessment were in effect on the Commencement Date, would be payable by Tenant hereunder or by
              Applicable Law), (ii) income, excess profits or other taxes, if any, of Landlord, determined on the basis of or
              measured wholly or in part by Landlord’s net income (unless such a tax is in the nature of a margin tax or other tax
              on rents, or is levied in lieu of or a substitute for any other tax or assessment upon or with respect to any of the
              Premises, which, if such other tax or assessment were in effect on the Commencement Date, would be payable by
              Tenant hereunder or by Applicable Law), (iii) any estate, inheritance, succession, gift or similar taxes of Landlord,
              (iv) any taxes in connection with the transfer or other disposition of any interest, other than Tenant’s (or any person
              claiming under Tenant), in the Premises or this Lease, to any person or entity, including, but not limited to, any
              capital gains, income, stamp or real property gains or withholding tax (unless attributable to an Event of Default or
              unless such transfer is to Tenant or a person designated by Tenant), or (v) any tax that would not have been imposed
              but for the failure of Landlord to comply with certification, information, documentation or other reporting
              requirements applicable to Landlord, if compliance with such requirements is required by statute or regulation of the
              relevant taxing authority as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, and (vi) any interest or penalties
              relating to any item listed in clauses (i) through (v) above.

                        (6) [Intentionally Deleted]

                         (7) The term “Actual Taxes” shall mean, with respect to each calendar year during the Term, the actual
              Taxes for such year. The term “Actual Tax Rate” shall mean, with respect to each calendar year during the Term,
              the Actual Taxes attributable to each square foot of rentable area in the Building (as set forth in Item 21 of the Basic
              Lease Information), and shall be calculated by dividing the Actual Taxes by the total number of square feet of
              rentable area in the Building. The term “Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual Taxes” shall mean, with respect
              to each calendar year during the Term, an amount equal to the product of (i) the Actual Tax Rate, multiplied by
              (ii) the sum of the number of square feet of rentable area in the Premises (as defined in Item 7(a) of the Basic Lease
              Information) in such year.

                       3.3.2 Tenant shall be obligated to pay to Landlord as additional rental an amount equal to Tenant’s
              Proportionate Share of Actual Operating Expenses. In addition, Tenant shall be obligated to pay to Landlord as
              additional rental an amount equal to Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual Taxes. To implement the foregoing,
              Landlord shall provide to Tenant on or before June 15 (or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible) after the end of
              the calendar year in which the Commencement Date occurs, a statement of the Actual Operating Expenses and the
              Actual Taxes for such calendar year, the Actual Operating Expenses Rate and the Actual Tax Rate for such calendar
              year, and Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual Operating Expenses, and Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual

                                                                            -5-

              Taxes for such calendar year. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s receipt of such
              statement, an amount equal to Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual Operating Expenses for such calendar year.
              Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s receipt of such statement, an amount equal to
              Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual Taxes for such calendar year.

                        3.3.3 Beginning with the Commencement Date (or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible), Landlord
              shall provide to Tenant a statement of (i) the projected annual Operating Expenses per square foot of rentable area in
              the Property (the “Projected Operating Expenses Rate”), and (ii) the projected annual Taxes per square foot of
              rentable area in the Property (the “Projected Tax Rate”). Beginning with the Commencement Date, Tenant shall
              pay to Landlord on the first day of each month an amount (the “Projected Operating Expenses Installment”)
              equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the product of (i) the Projected Operating Expenses Rate for such calendar year,
              multiplied by (ii) the sum of the number of square feet of rentable area in the Premises (as defined in Item 7(a) of
              the Basic Lease Information) on the first day of the prior month. Beginning with the Commencement Date, Tenant
              shall also pay to Landlord on the first day of each month an amount (the “Projected Tax Installment”) equal to
              one-twelfth (1/12) of the product of (i) the Projected Tax Rate for such calendar year, multiplied by (ii) the sum of
              the number of square feet of rentable area in the Premises (as defined in Item 7(a) of the Basic Lease Information)
              on the first day of the prior month. Until Tenant has received the statement of the Projected Operating Expenses
              Rate and Projected Tax Rate from Landlord, Tenant shall continue to pay Projected Operating Expenses Installments
              and Projected Tax Installments to Landlord in the same amount (if any) as required for the last month of the prior
              calendar year. Upon Tenant’s receipt of such statement of the Projected Operating Expenses Rate, Tenant shall pay
              to Landlord, or Landlord shall pay to Tenant (whichever is appropriate), the difference between the amount paid by
              Tenant as Projected Operating Expenses Installments prior to receiving such statement and the amount payable by
              Tenant therefor as set forth in such statement. In addition, upon Tenant’s receipt of such statement of the Projected
              Tax Rate, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, or Landlord shall pay to Tenant (whichever is appropriate), the difference
              between the amount paid by Tenant as Projected Tax Installments prior to receiving such statement and the amount
              payable by Tenant therefor as set forth in such statement. Landlord shall provide Tenant a statement on or before
              June 15 (or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible) after the end of each calendar year, showing the Actual
              Operating Expenses Rate as compared to the Projected Operating Expenses Rate for such calendar year and the
              Actual Tax Rate as compared to the Projected Tax Rate for such calendar year. If Tenant’s Proportionate Share of
              Actual Operating Expenses for such calendar year exceeds the aggregate of the Projected Operating Expenses
              Installments collected by Landlord from Tenant, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days following
              Tenant’s receipt of such statement, the amount of such excess. If Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual Taxes for
              such calendar year exceeds the aggregate of the Projected Tax Installments collected by Landlord from Tenant,
              Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days following Tenant’s receipt of such statement, the amount of
              such excess. If Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual Operating Expenses for such calendar year is less than the
              aggregate of the Projected Operating Expenses Installments collected by Landlord from Tenant, Landlord shall
              credit Tenant’s Rent hereunder, within thirty (30) days following Tenant’s receipt of such statement, the amount of
              such excess. If Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual Taxes for such calendar year is less than the aggregate of the
              Projected Tax Installments collected by Landlord from Tenant, Landlord shall credit Tenant’s Rent hereunder, within
              thirty (30) days following Tenant’s receipt of such statement, the amount of such excess. Landlord shall have the
              right from time to time during each calendar year to revise the Projected Operating Expenses Rate and/or Projected
              Tax Rate and provide Tenant with a revised statement thereof, and thereafter Tenant shall pay Projected Operating
              Expenses Installments and Projected Tax Installments on the basis of the revised statement. If the Commencement
              Date is not the first day of a calendar year, or the expiration or termination date of this Lease is not the last day of a
              calendar year, then Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual Operating Expenses and Tenant’s Proportionate Share of
              Actual Taxes shall be prorated. The foregoing adjustment provisions shall survive the expiration or termination of
              the Term.

                                                                            -6-





                                                                                                                                  Page

                        3.3.4 Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, it is agreed that if the Building is not
              ninety-five percent (95%) or more occupied on average during any calendar year commencing with calendar year
              2008 an adjustment shall be made in computing the Actual Operating Expenses (with respect only to those
              Operating Expenses which actually vary with occupancy) for such year so that the Actual Operating Expenses are
              computed as though the Building had been ninety-five percent (95%) occupied during such year.

                        3.3.5 Landlord agrees to keep books and records reflecting the Operating Expenses and Taxes of the
              Property in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Tenant, at its expense, shall have the right,
              within twelve (12) months (the “Audit Period”) after receiving Landlord’s statement of Actual Operating Expenses
              and Taxes for a particular year, to audit Landlord’s books and records relating to the Operating Expenses and Taxes
              as the case may be for such year and, in the event that the charge to Tenant related to any audited item is reasonably
              alleged to have resulted in an overcharge in excess of five percent (5%) of the total charge for such item in such
              audit year, Tenant shall be permitted, during the Audit Period, to audit the same item for the two (2) prior calendar
              years occurring during the Term of this Lease. If conducted by Tenant, such audit shall be conducted only during
              regular business hours at Landlord’s office and only after Tenant gives Landlord fourteen (14) days written notice.
              Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a copy of the results of such audit within fifteen (15) days of its receipt by Tenant.
              No audit shall be conducted at any time that there is an existing Event of Default by Tenant of any of terms of this
              Lease. No subtenant shall have any right to conduct an audit and no assignee shall conduct an audit for any period
              during which such assignee was not in possession of the Tenant Space. Such audit must be conducted by an
              independent nationally recognized accounting firm. All information obtained through the Tenant’s audit with respect
              to financial matters (including, without limitation, costs, expenses, income) and any other matters pertaining to the
              Landlord and/or the Property as well as any compromise, settlement, or adjustment reached between Landlord and
              Tenant relative to the results of the audit shall be held in strict confidence by the Tenant and its officers, agents, and
              employees; and Tenant shall cause its auditor and any of its officers, agents, and employees to be similarly bound.
              As a condition precedent to Tenant’s exercise of its right to audit, Tenant must deliver to Landlord a signed covenant
              from the auditor in a form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord acknowledging that all of the results of such audit as
              well as any compromise, settlement, or adjustment reached between Landlord and Tenant shall be held in strict
              confidence and shall not be revealed in any manner to any person except upon the prior written consent of Landlord,
              which consent may be withheld in Landlord’s sole discretion, or if required pursuant to any litigation between
              Landlord and Tenant materially related to the facts disclosed by such audit, or if required by law. Tenant understands
              and agrees that this provision is of material importance to Landlord and that any violation of the terms of this
              provision shall result in immediate and irreparable harm to Landlord. Landlord shall have all rights allowed by law
              or equity if Tenant, its officers, agents, or employees and/or the auditor violate the terms of this provision, including,
              without limitation, the right to terminate this Lease or the right to terminate Tenant’s right to audit in the future
              pursuant to this paragraph. Tenant shall indemnify, defend upon request, and hold Landlord harmless from and
              against all costs, damages, claims, liabilities, expenses, losses, court costs, and attorneys’ fees suffered by or claimed
              against Landlord, based in whole or in part upon the breach of the confidentiality provisions of this paragraph by
              Tenant and/or its auditor, and shall cause its auditor to be similarly bound. If within such the Audit Period Tenant
              does not give Landlord written notice stating in reasonable detail any objection to the statement of Actual Operating
              Expenses and/or Actual Taxes, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved such statement in all respects. In the event
              that Tenant’s audit reveals a cumulative overcharge of over five percent (5%), Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for
              the reasonable costs of the audit, including reasonable costs of Tenant’s counsel in connection therewith); provided
              that Landlord shall be obligated to reimburse Tenant for the reasonable costs accumulated during such audit on an
              hourly basis, not a contingency basis.

                   3.4 Payments Generally. Base Rent, all forms of Additional Rent (defined in this Section 3.4, below) payable
              hereunder by Tenant and all other amounts, fees, payments or charges payable hereunder by Tenant shall (i) each
              constitute rent payable hereunder (and shall sometimes collectively be referred to herein as “Rent”), (ii) be payable
              to Landlord when due without any prior notice or demand therefor in lawful money of the United States without any
              abatement, offset or deduction whatsoever (except as specifically
                                                                 Data Center Lease




                                                                            -7-
                                                                 Data Center Lease




                                                                                                                                  Page

              provided otherwise herein), and (iii) be payable to Landlord at the address of Landlord specified in Item 16 of the
              Basic Lease Information (or to such other person or to such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate
              in writing to Tenant). No receipt of money by Landlord from Tenant after the termination of this Lease, the service
              of any notice, the commencement of any suit, or a final judgment for possession shall reinstate, continue or extend
              the Term of this Lease or affect any such notice, demand, suit or judgment. No partial payment by Tenant shall be
              deemed to be other than on account of the full amount otherwise due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any
              check or any letter accompanying any check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord shall
              be entitled to accept such payment without compromise or prejudice to any of the rights of Landlord hereunder or
              under any Applicable Laws (defined in Section 6.3.1, below). In the event that the Commencement Date or the
              Expiration Date (or the date of any earlier termination of this Lease) falls on a date other than the first or last day of
              a calendar month, respectively, the Rent payable for such partial calendar month shall be prorated based on a per
              diem basis. For purposes of this Lease, all amounts (other than Base Rent) payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant
              to this Lease, whether or not denominated as such, shall constitute “Additional Rent.”

                   3.5 Late Payments. Tenant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the late payment by Tenant to Landlord of
              Base Rent or Additional Rent (or any other sums due hereunder) will cause Landlord to incur administrative costs
              not contemplated under this Lease and other damages, the exact amount of which would be extremely difficult or
              impractical to fix. Landlord and Tenant agree that if Landlord does not receive any such payment on or before the
              date that is five (5) days after the date on which such payment is due (a “Late Charge Delinquency”), Tenant shall
              pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, (i) a late charge (“Late Charge”) equal to five percent (5%) of the amount
              overdue to cover such additional administrative costs and damages, and (ii) interest on all such delinquent amounts
              at an interest rate (the “Default Rate”) equal to the lesser of (a) the Prime Rate (defined below) plus two hundred
              basis points per month or (b) the maximum lawful rate, from the date such amounts are first delinquent until the date
              the same are paid. In no event, however, shall the charges permitted under this Article 3 or elsewhere in this Lease,
              to the extent the same are considered to be interest under applicable law, exceed the maximum lawful rate of
              interest. Landlord’s acceptance of any Late Charge, or interest pursuant to this Section 3.5, shall not be deemed to
              constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default with respect to the overdue amount, nor prevent Landlord from exercising
              any of the other rights and remedies available to Landlord hereunder or under any Applicable Laws.
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord agrees to waive the Late Charge and interest at the Default Rate for one (1)
              late payment hereunder during any consecutive twelve (12) calendar month period during the Term; provided that
              such late payment is paid in full within five (5) days after the date Tenant receives written notice from Landlord that
              same is past due. For the purposes of this Lease, the term the “Prime Rate”, shall mean the rate of interest published
              as the “prime rate” by The Wall Street Journal (or its successor, assign or a comparable publication) in its listing of
              “Money Rates”.

                   3.6 Electrical Power. Tenant shall pay for all electricity provided to and/or used in the Tenant Space. An
              electrical metering device (or electrical metering devices) (collectively, the “Electrical Metering Equipment”)
              compatible with Landlord’s energy management system for monitoring electricity provided to and/or used in the
              Tenant Space shall be installed by Tenant at Tenant’s cost. Landlord shall bill Tenant monthly for the actual cost
              (with no mark-up by Landlord) of all electricity provided to and/or used in the Tenant Space based upon the
              Electrical Metering Equipment (the “Actual Electrical Costs”) which bill shall, upon request by Tenant, enclose the
              applicable portion of the utility company invoice. Tenant shall pay such amount (the “Power Payment”) to
              Landlord, as Additional Rent, within thirty (30) days of delivery of such Power Payment invoice. For the avoidance
              of doubt, it is the intent of the parties that this Section 3.6 represents a mechanism only for Landlord’s cost recovery
              with regard to electrical power provided to and/or used in or for the Premises, and that there is no intent for Tenant’s
              Power Payment to include any element of profit to the Landlord in connection therewith.
