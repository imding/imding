              installation and/or tender to Tenant delivery of possession of the Premises; provided, however, that, subject to Force
              Majeure (defined in Section 17.14, below), Tenant shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to terminate
              this Lease if such installation has not been completed and/or Landlord shall fail to tender delivery of possession of
              the Premises on or before the date that is sixty (60) days after the date set forth in Item 4 of the Basic Lease
              Information (as such date may be extended for Force Majeure).

              Term of this Lease with respect to the entire Tenant Space, each for an additional term of sixty (60) calendar months

                                              265 – 276                                         $509,650.01

                                              289 – 300                                         $540,687.69

                                                                            -2-
                                                               Data Center Lease




                                                                                                                              Page

                         2.3.2 Tenant may exercise each Renewal Option only by delivering to Landlord a written notice (an
              “Option Exercise Notice”) at least nine (9) calendar months (and not more than twenty-four (24) calendar months)
              prior to then applicable expiration date of the Term, which Option Exercise Notice shall specify that Tenant is
              irrevocably exercising its Renewal Option so as to extend the Term of this Lease by a Renewal Term on the terms
              set forth in this Section 2.3. In the event that Tenant shall duly exercise a Renewal Option, the Term shall be
              extended to include the applicable Renewal Term (and all references to the Term in this Lease shall be deemed to
              refer to the Term specified in Item 5 of the Basic Lease Information, plus all duly exercised Renewal Terms). In the
              event that Tenant shall fail to deliver an Option Exercise Notice within the applicable time period specified herein
              for the delivery thereof, time being of the essence, at the election of Landlord, Tenant shall be deemed to have
              forever waived and relinquished such Renewal Option, and any other options or rights to renew or extend the Term
              effective after the then applicable expiration date of the Term shall terminate and shall be of no further force or
              effect.

                       2.3.3 Tenant shall have the right to exercise any Renewal Option only with respect to the entire Tenant
              Space leased by Tenant at the time that Tenant delivers an Option Exercise Notice. If Tenant duly exercises a
              Renewal Option, Landlord and Tenant shall execute an amendment reflecting such exercise. Notwithstanding
              anything to the contrary herein, any attempted exercise by Tenant of a Renewal Option shall, be invalid, ineffective,
              and of no force or effect if, on the date on which Tenant delivers an Option Exercise Notice or on the date on which
              the Option Term is scheduled to commence there shall be an uncured Event of Default by Tenant under this Lease.
