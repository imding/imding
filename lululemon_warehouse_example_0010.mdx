 	At the written request of the Tenant, the Landlord shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain a non-disturbance agreement in favor of the Tenant from any Holder, provided the form of such agreement is acceptable to the Holder and the Landlord and further provided that the Tenant is responsible for the costs of obtaining such an agreement.
