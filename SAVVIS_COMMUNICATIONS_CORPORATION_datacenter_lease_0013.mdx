              15. TENANT DEFAULT.
                  15.1 Events of Default By Tenant. Each of the following acts or omissions of Tenant or occurrences shall
              constitute an “Event of Default”:
                       15.1.1 Any failure or refusal by Tenant to timely pay any Rent or any other payments or charges required to
              be paid hereunder, or any portion thereof, within five (5) days of notice that the same is due.

                        15.1.2 Any failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other covenant or condition of this Lease
              (including, without limitation, in the Building Rules and Regulations) to be performed or observed by Tenant (other
              than those described in Section 15.1.1, above or Sections 15.1.3, 15.1.4, or 15.1.5, below) if such failure continues
              for a period of thirty (30) days following written notice to Tenant of such failure; provided, however, that in the
              event Tenant’s failure to perform or observe any covenant or condition of this Lease to be performed or observed by
              Tenant cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days following written notice to Tenant, Tenant shall not be in
              default if Tenant commences to cure same within the thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the
              curing thereof to completion within ninety (90) days following such written notice.

                        15.1.3 The filing or execution or occurrence of any one of the following: (i) a petition in bankruptcy or
              other insolvency proceeding by or against Tenant, (ii) a petition or answer seeking relief under any provision of the
              Bankruptcy Act, (iii) an assignment for the benefit of creditors, (iv) a petition or other proceeding by or against
              Tenant for the appointment of a trustee, receiver or liquidator of Tenant or any of Tenant’s property, or (v) a
              proceeding by any governmental authority for the dissolution or liquidation of Tenant or any other instance whereby
              Tenant or any general partner of Tenant shall cease doing business as a going concern.

                                                                           -24-
                                                                 Data Center Lease




                       15.1.4 Any failure by Tenant to execute and deliver any statement or document described in either Article
              11 or Section 12.1 requested to be so executed and delivered by Landlord within the time periods specified therein
              applicable thereto, where such failure continues for three (3) days after delivery of written notice of such failure by
              Landlord to Tenant.

                        15.1.5 Intentionally Deleted.

                        The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all of the notice periods provided in this Section 15.1 are in
              lieu of, and not in addition to, the notice requirements of any Applicable Laws.

                  15.2 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord shall have, in addition to any
              other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, the option to pursue any one or more of the remedies
              described in Section 1 of Exhibit “D” attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, each and all of
              which shall, subject to applicable law, be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice or demand whatsoever
              (and all of the other provisions of Section 1 of Exhibit “D” shall apply to an Event of Default by Tenant hereunder).

              16. LIMITATION OF LANDLORD’S LIABILITY.
                   16.1 Landlord Default. In the event that Landlord shall fail to perform any obligation of Landlord to be
              performed under this Lease, Tenant’s sole and exclusive remedies for any such failure shall be an action for money
              damages, specific performance and/or injunctive relief (Tenant hereby waiving the benefit of any laws granting
              Tenant a lien upon the property of Landlord and/or upon rental due Landlord or granting Tenant a right to terminate
              this Lease upon a default by Landlord); provided, however, that Landlord shall not be in default hereunder (and
              Tenant shall have no right to pursue any such claim for damages in connection with any such failure) unless and
              until Tenant shall have delivered to Landlord a written notice specifying such default with particularity, and
              Landlord shall thereafter have failed to cure such default within thirty (30) days (or, if the nature of Landlord’s
              obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are reasonably required for its performance, then not unless
              Landlord shall have failed to commence such performance of such cure within such thirty (30) day period and
              thereafter diligently pursue the same to completion within ninety (90) days). The foregoing notwithstanding,
              Landlord agrees to commence Switch Gear Repairs and Water Repairs within twenty-four (24) hours following
              receipt of written notice from Tenant of the need for same, and shall diligently pursue the curing thereof to
              completion. Unless and until Landlord shall have so failed to so cure any such failure after such notice, Tenant shall
              not have any remedy or cause of action by reason thereof. All obligations of Landlord hereunder will be construed as
              covenants, not conditions.

                   16.2 Landlord’s Liability. In consideration of the benefits accruing under this Lease to Tenant and
              notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease or in any exhibits, riders, amendments, or addenda to this
              Lease (collectively, the “Lease Documents”), it is expressly understood and agreed by and between the parties to
              this Lease that: (i) the recourse of Tenant or its successors or assigns against Landlord (and the liability of Landlord
              to Tenant, its successors and assigns) with respect to (a) any actual or alleged breach or breaches by or on the part of
              Landlord of any representation, warranty, covenant, undertaking or agreement contained in any of the Lease
              Documents, or (b) any matter relating to Tenant’s occupancy of the Tenant Space (collectively, the “Landlord’s
              Lease Undertakings”), shall be limited to no more than an aggregate of Fifteen Million and No/100 Dollars
              ($15,000,000.00) (the “Liability Limit”); (ii) Tenant shall have no recourse against any other assets of the Landlord
              Group (as defined in the Basic Lease Information); (iii) except to the extent of the Liability Limit, no personal
              liability or personal responsibility of any sort with respect to any of Landlord’s Lease Undertakings or any alleged
              breach thereof is assumed by, or shall at any time be asserted or enforceable against, the Landlord Group, and (iv) at
              no time shall Landlord be responsible or liable to Tenant for any lost profits, lost economic opportunities or any
              form of consequential damages as the result of any actual or alleged breach of Landlord of Landlord’s Lease
              Undertakings.

                                                                           -25-
                                                                Data Center Lease




                   16.3 Transfer of Landlord’s Interest. Landlord shall have the right, from time to time, to assign its interest in
              this Lease in whole or, to a wholly owned subsidiary, in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any
              assignment in part to a wholly-owned subsidiary, (i) Landlord shall provide a written notice to Tenant specifying the
              rights and obligations so assigned and (ii) Landlord shall guaranty the performance of the obligations assigned to
              such wholly-owned subsidiary; provided, however, Landlord’s maximum liability under such guaranty shall not
              exceed the maximum liability it would have had under the Lease if such obligations had not been assigned. Landlord
              and each successor to Landlord shall be fully released from the performance of Landlord’s obligations under the
              Lease Documents upon their transfer of Landlord’s interest in the Property to a third party, except for any liabilities
              or obligations of Landlord then existing. Landlord shall not be liable for any obligation under the Lease Documents
              accruing after a transfer of its interest in the Property and Tenant agrees to look solely to the successor in interest of
              Landlord in and to this Lease for all obligations and liabilities accruing on or after the date of such transfer. If any
              security has been given by Tenant to secure the faithful performance of any of the covenants of this Lease, Landlord
              shall transfer or deliver said security, as such, to Landlord’s successor in interest and thereupon Landlord shall be
              discharged from any further liability with regard to said security.
