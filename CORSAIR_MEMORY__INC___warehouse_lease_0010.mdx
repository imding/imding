17. SUBROGATION
                   Landlord and Tenant hereby mutually waive any claim against the other and its Agents for any loss or damage
              to any of their property located on or about the Premises, the Building or the Project that is caused by or results from
              perils covered by property insurance carried by the respective parties, to the extent of the proceeds of such insurance
              actually received with respect to such loss or damage, whether or not due to the negligence of the other party or its
              Agents. Because the foregoing waivers will preclude the assignment of any claim by way of subrogation to an
              insurance company or any other person, each party now agrees to immediately give to its insurer written notice of
              the terms of these mutual waivers and shall have their insurance policies endorsed to prevent the invalidation of the
              insurance coverage because of these waivers. Nothing in this Paragraph 17 shall relieve a party of liability to the
              other for failure to carry insurance required by this Lease.

              18. SIGNS
                   Tenant shall not place or permit to be placed in, upon, or about the Premises, the Building or the Project any
              exterior lights, decorations, balloons, flags, pennants, banners, advertisements or notices, or erect or install any
              signs, windows or door lettering, placards, decorations, or


              advertising media of any type which can be viewed from the exterior of the Premises (including without limitation,
              being viewed from any of the interior Common Areas) without obtaining Landlord’s prior written consent. Tenant
              shall remove any sign, advertisement or notice placed on the Premises, the Building or the Project by Tenant upon
              the expiration of the Term or sooner termination of this Lease, and Tenant shall repair any damage or injury to the
              Premises, the Building or the Project caused thereby, all at Tenant’s expense. If any signs are not removed, or
              necessary repairs not made, Landlord shall have the right to remove the signs and repair any damage or injury to the
              Premises, the Building or the Project at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. In addition to any other rights or remedies
              available to Landlord, in the event that Tenant erects or installs any sign in violation of this Paragraph 18, and
              Tenant fails to remove same within three (3) business days after notice from Landlord or erects or installs a similar
              sign in the future, Landlord shall have the right to charge Tenant a signage fee equal to $100.00 per day for each day
              thereafter that such sign is not removed or a similar sign is installed or erected in the future. Landlord’s election to
              charge such fee shall not be deemed to be a consent by Landlord to such sign and Tenant shall remain obligated to
              remove such sign in accordance with Landlord’s notice.

                   Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, shall have the right to place a Building-standard sign on the Building
              and on the monument serving the Premises; provided, however, that the location, size, design and method of
              attachment to the Building of any such sign shall strictly comply with all Laws, and shall be subject to Landlord’s
              prior reasonable approval.

              19. FREE FROM LIENS
                   Tenant shall keep the Premises, the Building and the Project free from any liens arising out of any work
              performed, material furnished or obligations incurred by or for Tenant. In the event that Tenant shall not, within ten
              (10) days following the imposition of any such lien, cause the lien to be released of record by payment or posting of
              a proper bond, Landlord shall have in addition to all other remedies provided herein and by law the right but not the
              obligation to cause same to be released by such means as it shall deem proper, including payment of the claim
              giving rise to such lien. All such sums paid by Landlord and all expenses incurred by it in connection therewith
              (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) shall be payable to Landlord by Tenant upon demand. Landlord shall
              have the right at all times to post and keep posted on the Premises any notices permitted or required by law or that
              Landlord shall deem proper for the protection of Landlord, the Premises, the Building and the Project, from
              mechanics’ and materialmen’s liens. Tenant shall give to Landlord at least five (5) business days’ prior written notice
              of commencement of any repair or construction on the Premises.

              20. ENTRY BY LANDLORD
                  Tenant shall permit Landlord and Landlord’s Agents to enter into and upon the Premises at all reasonable times,
              upon reasonable notice (except in the case of an emergency, for which no notice shall be required), and subject to
              Tenant’s reasonable security arrangements, for the purpose of inspecting the same or showing the Premises to
              prospective purchasers or lenders, or during the last six (6) months of the Term, to prospective tenants, or to alter,
              improve, maintain and repair the Premises or the Building as required or permitted of Landlord under the terms
              hereof, or for any other business purpose, without any rebate of Rent and without any liability to



              Tenant for any loss of occupation or quiet enjoyment of the Premises thereby occasioned (except for actual damages
              resulting from the sole active gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord); Tenant shall permit Landlord to
              post notices of non-responsibility and ordinary “for sale” signs, and during the last six (6) months of the Term, to
              post ordinary “for lease” signs. No such entry shall be construed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into, or a detainer
              of the Premises, or an eviction or constructive eviction of Tenant from the Premises. Landlord may temporarily close
              entrances, doors, corridors, elevators or other facilities without liability to Tenant by reason of such closure in the
              case of an emergency and when Landlord otherwise deems such closure necessary.
