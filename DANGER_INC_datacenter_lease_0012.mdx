                   A.   All cables to and from the Tenant space must run in the common area cable management system – there are no
                        exceptions.
                   B.   For datacenter users, the under floor cable management is used for all cable runs. Any tile modifications must be
                        approved by the Building Engineer.
                   C.   If it is necessary for the raised floor tiles to be cut, they will be performed by the building or datacenter engineering
                        staff. After the initial installation, all additional tile cuts will be at an additional cost. NO tile cutting will be done in
                        the raised floor room.
                   D.   For telco users, overhead ladder racks are used for copper and coaxial cables, and fiber guide trays are used for fiber
                        runs.
                   E.   All cables, to the extent that they exit the Premises (i.e., to the extent that they are located under the raised floor or
                        outside of the cage or Building walls that demise the Premises (all such cables are referred to herein as “Interspace
                        Cables”)) must be bundled together using the approved materials as provided within this document. The standard for
                        Interspace Cables is wax-coated string or Velcro-ties for ease of installation and removal. No plastic tie-straps for
                        Interspace Cables will be permitted.**

                   G.   At no time will Interspace Cables be allowed to extend beyond the rack/tray edges. Interspace Cable bundles will be
                        kept in a neat and orderly fashion to maintain workability and appearance.**
                        **    Landlord agrees not to modify this item 5.0G, during the Term of the Lease, as it relates to Tenant and/or the
