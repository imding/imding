              38. BROKERS
                   Landlord and Tenant each represents and warrants to the other that neither it nor its officers or agents nor
              anyone acting on its behalf has dealt with any real estate broker except the Broker(s) specified in the Basic Lease
              Information in the negotiating or making of this Lease, and each party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the

              in conjunction with any such claim or claims of any other broker or brokers to a commission in connection with this

              39. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                   In the event of any default or breach by Landlord under this Lease or arising in connection herewith or with
              Landlord’s operation, management, leasing, repair, renovation, alteration or any other matter relating to the Project
              or the Premises Tenant’s remedies shall be limited solely and exclusively to an amount which is equal to the lesser
              of (a) the interest in the Building of the then-current Landlord or (b) the equity interest Landlord would have in the
              Building if the Building were encumbered by third party debt in an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the
              value of the Building (as such value is reasonably determined by Landlord) provided that in no event shall such
              liability extend to any sales or insurance proceeds received by Landlord or the “Landlord Parties” in connection with
              the Project, Building or Premises. For purposes of this Lease, “Landlord Parties” shall mean, collectively,
              Landlord, its partners, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, investment advisors, or any successor in interest
              of any of them. Neither Landlord, nor any of the Landlord Parties shall have any personal liability therefor, and
              Tenant hereby expressly waives and releases such personal liability on behalf of itself and all persons claiming by,
              through or under Tenant. The limitations of liability contained in this Paragraph 39 shall inure to the benefit of
              Landlord’s and the Landlord Parties’ present and future partners, beneficiaries, officers, directors, trustees,
              shareholders, agents and employees, and their respective partners, heirs, successors and assigns. Under no
              circumstances shall any present or future partner of Landlord (if Landlord is a partnership), future member in
              Landlord (if Landlord is a limited liability company) or trustee or beneficiary (if Landlord or any partner or member
              of Landlord is a trust), have any liability for the performance of Landlord’s obligations under this Lease.
              Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, neither Landlord nor the Landlord Parties shall be liable under any
              circumstances for injury or damage to, or interference with Tenant’s business, including but not limited to, loss of
              profits, loss of rents or other revenues, loss of business opportunity, loss of goodwill or loss of use, in each case,
              however occurring. The provisions of this Paragraph 39 shall apply only to the Landlord, the Landlord Parties and
              the other parties herein described, and shall not be for the benefit of any insurer nor any other third party.
